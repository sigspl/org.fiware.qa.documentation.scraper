Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application logic, and UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent and value-adding composite applications. They are targeted at leveraging the \"long tail\" of the Web of Services (a.k.a. the Programmable Web) by exploiting rapid development, DIY, and shareability. They typically serve a specific situational (i.e. immediate, short-lived, customized) need, frequently with high potential for reuse. Is this \"situational\" character which precludes them to be offered as 'off-the-shelf' functionality by solution providers, and therefore creates the need for a tool like Wirecloud \n\n Note:  Wirecloud is at the core of the FIWARE infrastructure and is therefore intended to be installed by FIWARE platform providers when setting up a configuring a new instance of the FIWARE instance node. It is not intended to be deployed/configured by a developer. Developers are encouraged to use  the global instance of Wirecloud provided in the FIWARE Lab . Nevertheless, we provide an installer for stand-alone instances of Wirecloud, along with recipes and blueprints to install it in the Cloud portal (using the PaaS Manager), and the corresponding installation guides. \n\n Why to get it \n\n Web application mashups can be manually developed using conventional web programming technologies (e.g. see http://programmableweb.com). But this fails to take full advantage of the approach. Mashup tools and platforms like Wirecloud aim at development  paradigms that do not require programming skills  and, hence, target end users, being them citizens, knowledge workers, portal designers, etc. \n\n By using Wirecloud you have access to the following key features: \n\n \n Innovate through experimentation by choosing the best suited widgets, operators and prefab mashup-lets for your devised mashup from a vast, ever-growing distributed catalogue  \n\n The wiring editor allows you to easily connect widgets in a mashup to create a full-fledged dashboard with RIA functionality \n\n The piping editor allows you to easily connect widgets to back-end services or data sources through an extendable set of operators, including filters, aggregators, adapters, etc. \n\n Share your newly created mashup with other colleagues and users. Comment it, tag it and rate it to foster discoverability and shareability \n\n Help to build a strong community by commenting, tagging and rating others' widgets, operators and mashups.

Location information, lighting information, device orientation, heading direction are the necessary contextual information and based on the service these other information available to the browser can be used. Air pressure, time the image is taken are some of the available important meta data can also be used as \"Tagging content\". Tagging can be similar to the contemparary geo tagging but highly dependent on the image format (JPEG, PNG, ogg, wmv, ect....). Exif extension method can be used if the format used is JPEG and for image formats such as PNG another method can be used. Format of the image in image capture depends on the usage scenario. For example in a situation where image processing is minimal JPEG compresssion can be better over PNG lossless images. \n\n Why to get it \n\nPhotos taken from devices combined with the meta data shown as Tag are transferred to the 2D3D capture server. 2D 3D capture server API then can be used to dig up image based on time, location for use of other applications where 2D or 3D visual information is required. In the use case described here 3D scene builder can be a part of other GEs such as POI. Another use case is, using tagged images published by other services or devices such as Flickr to build a 3d model of the current location so that a person such as lost tourist could find his way. Elaborating on the \"Tag\" and its content, images are geo-tagged in order to improve the user experience in social networks images. 3D information can be used similarly to improve the quality of the user experience and meta data that can be associated with a model improves number of use cases 3d modelling can be used. Most importantly information such as orientation of the device at the moment which the photo is taken can be used to improve the accuracy and it also helps to filter out less useful images from the useful once. In a hypothetical security situation where two images taken from known locations by two security cameras at the same time could be useful in identifying a criminal who happened to be at that location. By using meta data such as lighting conditions the accuracy of the 3d model of the criminal can be improved and will avoid innocent being targeted. \n\n Open specification reference \nThis component has been designed according the  2D/3D Capture GE Open Specification .", "enabler": "2D/3D Capture", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       3.2.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-31      \n        Contact Person:       Cyberlightning      \n            contact@cyberlightning.com      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

The services provided, even if they can be used in isolation offer their most when used conjointly to cover the whole & primary usage pattern. Hereafter is the list of services offered by the Security Monitoring  \n \n MulVAL Attack Paths Engine \n Scored Attack Paths \n Remediation \n \n\n MulVAL Attack Paths Engine \nMulVAL Attack Paths Engine Component is an end-to-end framework and reasoning system that conducts multihost, multistage vulnerability analysis on a network.   MulVAL Attack Paths Engine is accessed using web browser, allowing all users  to generate the attack graphs using the common stream protocol and port (HTTP on port 80).\nAttack graph presents a qualitative view of security discrepancies:\n \n It shows what attacks are possible, but does not tell you how bad the problem is. \n It captures the interactions among all attack possibilities in your system. \n \n\n\n \n\n Scored Attack Paths \nScored Attack Paths represents the next step, following the metrics provided by the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine. Based on the Attack Graph provided by the Mulval Attack Paths Engine, and the individual scores of each step, the objective is to yield the possible attack paths, along with a score associated to each one of the paths.\n\nThe considered attack paths that will be included in the list are selected based on the target node selected in the attack graph. The score of each path reflects the risk associated to the path as a whole, based on the individual scores of each step that have been previously calculated by the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine.\n\nAdditionally to the risk score metric, the score of each path will include a second scoring component that will account for the impact on the processes linked to the IT resource(s) being either\n \n solely at the target node of the attack path \n on the attack path \n \n\nThe main idea of scoring attack paths is to consider paths independently from one another, as opposed to the approach of the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine, composed of individual scores, the latter being computed by taking into account all the connections existing in the attack graph. \n\n\n\n \n\n Remediation \nRemediation provides tools to security operators for proposing cost-sensitive remediations to attack paths.\n\nThe attack paths are shown to a security operator, ordered by their scores, which allow to easily understand the severity of the consequences of the attack paths. To calculate the remediation to the chosen attack path, the tool first extracts the necessary information from the attack path to be corrected. Then, it computes several lists of remediations that could reduce / cut this attack path. Finally, it estimates the cost of each list of remediations and proposes all the lists of remediations, ordered by cost, to security operators. Operators can choose one remediation list and, thanks to the remediation validation, check whether or not the system is more secure after the application of this remediation. \n\nTo compute remediations, a remediation database is needed. It will be external to the GE, as the vulnerability database. This database makes a connection between vulnerabilities (for example thanks to a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier - CVE ID) and a possible adapted remediation. Several types of remediation could be used, for example a patch (it corrects a vulnerability) or a signature of known attacks (it prevents the exploitation of a vulnerability). To build the remediation database, information about patches can be extracted from publicly available in Security Advisories (for example, coming from CERT-EU or the National Vulnerability Database). Information about signatures and the related vulnerability could be extracted from the signatures database that contains the CVE ID. The last type of remediation provided by the remediation tool can not be stored in the remediation database, because it is a topological remediation. This remediation is providing firewall rules that can prevent the intrusion of the attacker.\n\nTo sort the list of remediations, a cost function is applied to compute an estimate cost of each list. This cost contains two main components: operational costs and impact costs. The operational costs represent the costs caused by the deployment of the remediations, such as:\n\n \n Length of the deployment \n Maintenance \n Tests costs \n \n\nwhereas the impact costs represents the negative impact (side effects) that could happen following a remediation deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why to get it \n\nMulVAL Attack Paths Engine is contributing risk management of IT infrastructure.\n\nMuVAL Attack Paths Engine allows you  evaluating the security risk assessment, the potential attack paths and improves the capability to detect security breach and the cyber-resilience of infrastructures.\n\nThe Scored Attack Paths offers an assessment tool that allows users to obtain the attack paths existing in an attack graph, along with their respective individual scores. The score of each attack path allows to assess the risk value and business impact for the target associated to the attack path.\n\nThe Scored Attack Paths is aimed at users who want to either:\n\n \n Utilize the Remediation asset \n Evaluate the situation of their IT infrastructure from the security and business impact viewpoint \n Improve the security configurations through what-if analysis \n \n\nRemediation is aimed at users who want to either:\n\n \n Show attack paths to a security operator \n  Order attack paths by their scores \n Apply a cost function to compute an estimate cost of each list \n \n\n\n Open Specification reference \n\n The Open Specifications of the MulvAL Attack Paths Engine in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following links: \n Mulval Attack Paths Engine API Specification \n Mulval Attack Paths Engine  Web Application API Specification \n\n\n The Open Specification of the Scored Attack Paths in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following link: \n Scored Attack Paths API Specification \n\n The Open Specification of the Remediation in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following link: \n Remediation API Specification \n\n", "enabler": "Security Monitoring", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2015-09-02      \n        Contact Person:       Olivier Bettan / Susana Gonz\u00e1lez Zarzosa      \n            olivier.bettan@thalesgroup.com\nsusana.gzarzosa@atos.net      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

CEP technology is sometimes also referred to as event stream analysis, or real time event correlation.\n \n\n \n   Cepheus  is divided in two simple deployable applications. The first one is a light NGSI broker which features an implementation of  the standardized NGSI API .

It targets IoT gateways and embedded systems.\n \n \n  IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE is the first stage of intelligence, filtering and aggregating sensor events thanks to smart but simple rules. It collects NGSI data in real-time from compliant IoT protocol adapters, transform them to value-added application relevant events, then finally propagate them towards the subscribers. Subscribed applications are now able to collect filtered-relevant real-time data, thus externalizing the responsibility for dedicated development of asynchronous data analysis.

The  IoT Broker  implementation available through the FIWARE Catalogue is the reference implementation of this Generic Enabler by NEC. This implementation satisfies all properties described in the specification of the Generic Enabler.\n\nThe IoT Broker has unique properties that you will not find in other IoT Platforms:\n\n \n  While the IoT Broker GE decouples applications from underlying IoT device installations, it achieves this going far beyond the common publish/subscribe paradigm. Instead, the IoT Broker actively communicates simultaneously with large quantities IoT gateways and devices in order to obtain exactly the information that is required by the running IoT applications. As a result, information only is generated and exchanged when needed. This is in contrast to the state-of-the-art middleware components where any piece of information - whether needed or not - is just ''dumped'' inside a central repository.\n  The IoT Broker has the ability to automatically translate information to the right abstraction level and therefore closes the gap between information-centric applications and device-centric IoT installations. For example, a simple device can typically only deliver values without being aware of the meaning of these values in the application's context. On the other hand, IoT applications have to written without consideration of the device installations in order to be applicable in more than one specific environment. This gap is closed by the IoT Broker by the use of so-called  associations  between device-level and thing-level information.\n \n\nThe IoT Broker Generic Enabler is based on the simple and powerful information model standardized in  OMA Next Generation Service Interface Context Enabler (NGSI 9 / NGSI 10) . This API has emerged in FIWARE as an important open standard of information exchange, implemented by a considerable number of FIWARE GEs. In NGSI 9/10, all objects of the real world, being it sensor/actuator devices or arbitrary objects (like tables, rooms, cars, ...) are represented as so-called Context Entities, while information about these objects is expressed in the form of  attributes .

In order to do this, the user employs the 'Reset current database'.\n\n \n Step 6 \n \nAfter having input the MulVAL file, and loaded the XML database of the file, the user needs to select the normalization method, the score formula, and simply click on the 'Score' button.\n\n \n Manuals  \n  \n A high-level description of the overall architecture of the Scored Attack Paths in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Architecture Description \n The description of the Scored Attack Paths provided in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Scored Attack Paths Description \n\n The provided API of the Scored Attack Paths is specified in the  API Specification \n The installation and administration guide of Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  Installation and Administration Guide \n\n\n \n Tutorials       \n\n\n The user and programmer guide of Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  User and Programmer Guide \n The tutorial to test the Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  Unit Testing Plan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Remediation \n\n Quick reference guide \n\nThe remediation application provides tools to security operators for proposing cost-sensitive remediations to attack paths. This application is written in Java and has a web-interface provided by the Vaadin library. This quick guide explains how to use this web application. \n\n \n Step 1 \n  \nAttack path view:\n\nThe main view contains a representation of the attack path to correct. The first attack path printed is the first ranked (according to the attack paths ranking function). The user can choose another attack path to print in a combo box. The vertices of the attack path have different colours, according to the type of vertex (OR, AND, LEAF or GOAL). The labels of the vertices explain the type of action made by the attacker. A more detailed caption can be found by clicking the \"Show caption\" button under the attack path view. \n\n \n Step 2 \n \nAttack path topologic view:\n\nNext to the attack path view, can be seen a more abstracted and topologic view of the attack path. This view show the different access made by the attacker accross the information system during the attack. This view also show the target machine of the attack and all the compromised machines.\n\n \n Step 3 \n \nRemediation choice:\n\nOn the bottom of the GUI, the security operator can choice several sets of remediation that can correct the attack path. The remediation set with the lower cost is chosen by default, but the operator can choose another one with the appropriate combo-box. To simulate the application of a remediation and its effects on the attack path, the operator can click on the related checkbox and then reset the applied remediations with the button \"Reset remediations\".\n \n \n Manuals  \n  \n A high-level description of the overall architecture of the Remediation in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Architecture Description \n The description of the Remediation provided in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Remediation Description \n The provided API of the Remediation is specified in the  API Specification \n The installation and administration guide of the Remediation is provided in the  Installation and Administration Guide \n\n\n \n Tutorials       \n\n\n The user and programmer guide of the Remediation is provided in the  User and Programmer Guide \n The tutorial to test the Remediation is provided in the  Unit Testing Plan \n\n\n", "enabler": "Security Monitoring", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2015-09-02      \n        Contact Person:       Olivier Bettan / Susana Gonz\u00e1lez Zarzosa      \n            olivier.bettan@thalesgroup.com\nsusana.gzarzosa@atos.net      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 "},

{"url": "https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/stream-oriented-kurento", "text": "What you get \n\nThe Stream Oriented GE is a development framework that provides an abstraction layer for multimedia capabilities, allowing non-expert developers to include interactive media components to their applications. At the heart of this enabler there is the Open API. A REST-like API, based on JSON RPC 2.0, exposing a toolbox of Media Elements that can be chained to create complex media processing pipelines.\n\nThe Stream Oriented GE provides several client implementations of the Open API. The Java client allows developers to include media capabilities to Java or JEE applications. There is also a Javascript client ready to be used with NodeJS or directly in browser applications.\n\nThanks to these, the Stream Oriented GE provides developers with a set of robust end-to-end interoperable multimedia communication capabilities to deal with the complexity of transport, encoding/decoding, processing and rendering tasks in an easy and efficient way. \n\n Why get it \n\nThe development of interactive multimedia applications is a complex task, which usually requires specific expertise and huge investments. Stream Oriented GE brings a number of abstractions and enablers democratizing multimedia technologies and making possible to any WWW developer to create powerful applications involving advanced features such as: interoperable audiovisual communications, computer vision, augmented reality, flexible media playing, recording, etc.\n\nThe Stream Oriented GE will be particularly useful and intuitive for developers familiar with Java EE and JavaScript technologies, although its capabilities are also exposed through agnostic interoperable network interfaces that can be consumed from any other language of system.\n\nIn a nutshell, It makes possible the development of complex interactive multimedia communications in a fast, simple and easy way.\n\n Open Specifications \n\nKurento is an implementation of the FIWARE  Stream Oriented Generic Enabler  . More specifically, Kurento implements the  Stream Oriented Open API Specification  and provides  Java and Javascript client implementations to access media capabilities \n", "enabler": "Stream-oriented - Kurento", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       6.6.0      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Luis L\u00f3pez      \n            luis.lopez@urjc.es\n      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n
