This means that thre is an Ultralight2.0 IoT Agent with different trasnport options (currently HTTP or MQTT) that may be increased in the future (e.g. supporting CoAP in the forthcomming Sprints).\nYou will select and use only those IoT Agents supporting the IoT semantics and trasnport protocol your devices/gateways actually use. \n The IoT Agent Manager component delivered at Release 4 is still not available with node.js and thefore it will be announced in the forthcoming sprints. This component addresses monitoring and management of IoT Agent instances. You only need this component for complex scenarios with multiple IoT Agent instances. \n The Northbound API of IDAS (i.e. all IoT Agents plus the IoT Manager) is the OMA NGSI protocol, as long as IoT Agents are normally expected to be connected to an NGSI Broker, such as the   Orion ContextBroker \n A Library for IoT Agents in node.js is provided for those IoT integrators willing to implement a new IoT specific standard/propietary protocol themselves. \n A  Reference client tool called FIGWAY to connect physical devices or experiment with virtual devices for simulation exercises using UL2.0/HTTP protocol. UL2.0 is an open and light protocol specification for devices. \n An IoT Edge Manager component is being implement in Release 5 onwards. Initially it stores and handles the communications and/or IoT-gateways topology and details as NGSI entities. This testing implementation is being developed as part of FIGWAY tool. In the future it may address more functions beyond storage/description related to IoT networks, IoT Gateways and IoT end-nodes operations. \n \n \n \n\n Why to get it \nYou need this component if you plan to connect IoT devices/gateways to FIWARE-based ecosystems. IDAS IoT Agents translate IoT-specific protocols into the NGSI context information protocol, that is the FIWARE standard data exchange model. You do not need this component if your devices or gateways natively support the NGSI API. \n \n \nBy using this component (in reality just the IoT Agents related to your devices IoT protocols), your devices will be represented in a FIWARE platform as NGSI entities in a ContextBroker. This means that you can query or subscribe to changes of device parameters status by querying or subscribing to the corresponding NGSI entity attributes at the ContextBroker.\n \n \nAdditionally, you may trigger commands to your actuation devices just by updating specific command-related attributes in their NGSI entities representation at the Contaxt Broker.\n \nThis way, all developers interactions with devices are handled at a ContextBroker, providing an homogeneous API and interface as for all other non-IoT data in a FIWARE ecosystem.\n \n \n\n Open specification reference \n\nIDAS component has been designed according the    BE Device Management   Open Specification.

Indeed, as mandated by the GE specification, this implementation provides an API to get authorization decisions based on authorization policies, and authorization requests from PEPs. The API follows the REST architecture style, and complies with XACML v3.0. XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) is a OASIS standard for authorization policy format and evaluation logic, as well as for the authorization decision request/response format. The PDP (Policy Decision Point) and the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) terms are defined in the XACML standard. This GEri plays the role of a PDP.\n \n \nTo fulfill the XACML architecture, you may need a PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) to protect your application, which is not provided here. For REST APIs, we recommend you use the  PEP Proxy by UPM available in the catalogue .\n \n\n Why to get it \nProviding authorization for your application is a must for security reasons. However, it is always a complex part to implement, especially for non-security developers, because it involves advanced security concepts (Identity-based, RBAC, ABAC, etc.). Most developers embed the authorization logic within the application code, which makes it hard to maintain, evolve and integrate with external services providing extra authorization attributes. In this regard, the Authorization PDP helps you externalize the authorization logic and take advantage of flexible and standard-compliant Attribute-Based Access Control features. Combined with the Identity Management GE and the PEP proxy, this gives you a comprehensive access control solution for your application. Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Authorization PDP Specification The Authorization PDP specification defines a RESTful API of an Authorization Policy Decision Point (PDP) compliant with the OASIS XACML standard.

Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application logic, and UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent and value-adding composite applications. They are targeted at leveraging the \"long tail\" of the Web of Services (a.k.a. the Programmable Web) by exploiting rapid development, DIY, and shareability. They typically serve a specific situational (i.e. immediate, short-lived, customized) need, frequently with high potential for reuse. Is this \"situational\" character which precludes them to be offered as 'off-the-shelf' functionality by solution providers, and therefore creates the need for a tool like Wirecloud \n\n Note:  Wirecloud is at the core of the FIWARE infrastructure and is therefore intended to be installed by FIWARE platform providers when setting up a configuring a new instance of the FIWARE instance node. It is not intended to be deployed/configured by a developer. Developers are encouraged to use  the global instance of Wirecloud provided in the FIWARE Lab . Nevertheless, we provide an installer for stand-alone instances of Wirecloud, along with recipes and blueprints to install it in the Cloud portal (using the PaaS Manager), and the corresponding installation guides. \n\n Why to get it \n\n Web application mashups can be manually developed using conventional web programming technologies (e.g. see http://programmableweb.com). But this fails to take full advantage of the approach. Mashup tools and platforms like Wirecloud aim at development  paradigms that do not require programming skills  and, hence, target end users, being them citizens, knowledge workers, portal designers, etc. \n\n By using Wirecloud you have access to the following key features: \n\n \n Innovate through experimentation by choosing the best suited widgets, operators and prefab mashup-lets for your devised mashup from a vast, ever-growing distributed catalogue  \n\n The wiring editor allows you to easily connect widgets in a mashup to create a full-fledged dashboard with RIA functionality \n\n The piping editor allows you to easily connect widgets to back-end services or data sources through an extendable set of operators, including filters, aggregators, adapters, etc. \n\n Share your newly created mashup with other colleagues and users. Comment it, tag it and rate it to foster discoverability and shareability \n\n Help to build a strong community by commenting, tagging and rating others' widgets, operators and mashups.

This includes both the application provisioning phase for as well as the on going life-cycle management of applications. The application management services interacts with the Compute service, Image service, and Network service by using the Orchestrator service in order to management the whole infrastructure.\n\n\nHence, Murano introduces an application catalog to OpenStack, enabling application developers and cloud administrators to publish various cloud-ready applications in a browsable categorized catalog.\nThe main capabilities provided for a cloud hosting user are:\n \n  Application Catalogue, including all the software to be instantiated \n  Deploy of complex application configuration in terms of blueprint templates \n  Support for configuration languages (such as puppet or chef) for the installation of the software \n  Manage life cycle of the application \n \n\n Why to get it \nThe middleware that an application needs to execute their logic can be manually deployed in the cloud. But this is a chronophage and repetitive operation ad eternum. Opposite to it, Murano provides the following advantages:\n \n Cost savings\n    This component helps improve the efficiency of IT resources and processes that form part of application delivery in any enterprise. Murano facilitates the creation of applications and services without the complexity and cost of provisioning the required resources and the management of the traditional application platform stack. Just in a few minutes you can use your applications without have to any infrastructure or configure operation over the needed resources. \n     Faster delivery of applications\n    Murano increases the benefits of Agile Software Development methodologies through the reduction of expended time to deliver software application projects. The architecture of your application is defined once and reused each time that you need to deliver the applications. \n     Increased adaptability\n    Murano reduces the architectural complexity and allows adapting the applications and IT services to answer quickly to new conditions market and organization changes. Any changes on them is translated quickly to the description of your application middleware.  \n Open Specifications \nApplication Management - Murano is an open source, reference implementation of the  FIWARE App Management Generic Enabler .

The provided TundraSDK and TundraClient can connect to a realXtend Tundra server. Implementing the Tundra network protocol via WebSocket and rendering with WebGL.\n\nFor networked multiuser usage requires a Tundra server (Synchronization GE server side).\n\n Why to get it \n\nDevelop realtime multi-user 3D applications using the realXtend platform, with the Three.js graphics API for WebGL.\n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 3D-UI WebTundra is an open source reference implementation of the FI-WARE Advanced Web Interfaces client core. It integrates 3D UI with realtime synchronization. Other GEs like Virtual Characters, Interface Designer, 2D-UI, POI and GIS clients etc. can be integrated to it as plugins.\n\nThe Entity-Component based scene model from realXtend is used as the internal representation and programming model. WebTundra's network and scene modules are the client side implementation of the Synchronization GE. The 3D UI part is implemented as a view to the synchronised data, using the Three.js renderer. Limited XML3D support is provided to read the scene from an xml description, instead of using a remote server. Mapping between the realXtend EC model and the XML3D specification is described in the 3D UI Open Specification.\n\n \n See  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.MiWi.Synchronization  for more information about the real-time synchronization protocol and the scene model in WebTundra. \n See  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.MiWi.3D-UI  for the xml3d specification and how we map it to the realXtend EC model. \n See  threejs.org  for more information and demos of the underlying graphics renderer used \n \n\n Community contact points \n\n \n#realxtend & #realxtend-dev on freenode IRC \nrealxtend & realxtend-dev groups in google groups\n\n \nhttp://github.com/realXtend/WebTundra/ Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "3DUI - WebTundra", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       5.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-09-26      \n        Contact Person:       Cvetan Stefanovski      \n            support@meshmoon.com      \n            FIWARE GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

All nodes within this graph are also nodes in the web sites DOM tree representation and can be accessed and changed via JavaScript like any other common DOM elements as well. On these DOM nodes, HTML events can be registered similar to known HTML elements. Resources for mesh data can be stored externally in any kind of external format (e.g. JSON, XML or binary) and referenced by URL. XML3D is designed to work efficiently with modern GPUs and Graphics API (such as OpenGL/WebGL) but still tries to stay independent of the rendering algorithm.\n\nIn addition to XML3D, Xflow allows to combine the scene graph with dataflows. Xflow is a declarative data flow representation that was designed for complex computations on XML3D elements. These computations include for example skinned meshes and key frame animations. \n \n \n\n \n Why to get it \n\nIntegrate interactive 3D graphics into your Web-based application!

Location information, lighting information, device orientation, heading direction are the necessary contextual information and based on the service these other information available to the browser can be used. Air pressure, time the image is taken are some of the available important meta data can also be used as \"Tagging content\". Tagging can be similar to the contemparary geo tagging but highly dependent on the image format (JPEG, PNG, ogg, wmv, ect....). Exif extension method can be used if the format used is JPEG and for image formats such as PNG another method can be used. Format of the image in image capture depends on the usage scenario. For example in a situation where image processing is minimal JPEG compresssion can be better over PNG lossless images. \n\n Why to get it \n\nPhotos taken from devices combined with the meta data shown as Tag are transferred to the 2D3D capture server. 2D 3D capture server API then can be used to dig up image based on time, location for use of other applications where 2D or 3D visual information is required. In the use case described here 3D scene builder can be a part of other GEs such as POI. Another use case is, using tagged images published by other services or devices such as Flickr to build a 3d model of the current location so that a person such as lost tourist could find his way. Elaborating on the \"Tag\" and its content, images are geo-tagged in order to improve the user experience in social networks images. 3D information can be used similarly to improve the quality of the user experience and meta data that can be associated with a model improves number of use cases 3d modelling can be used. Most importantly information such as orientation of the device at the moment which the photo is taken can be used to improve the accuracy and it also helps to filter out less useful images from the useful once. In a hypothetical security situation where two images taken from known locations by two security cameras at the same time could be useful in identifying a criminal who happened to be at that location. By using meta data such as lighting conditions the accuracy of the 3d model of the criminal can be improved and will avoid innocent being targeted. \n\n Open specification reference \nThis component has been designed according the  2D/3D Capture GE Open Specification .

By also using the Synchronization GE which is contained in the same codebase, multi-user networked experiences such as virtual worlds can be created.\n\n Source code \n\n http://github.com/realXtend/WebTundra/ \n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Virtual Characters Open Specification Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Virtual Characters", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       3.3      \n        Updated:       2016-01-13      \n        Contact Person:       Lasse \u00d6\u00f6rni [LudoCraft]      \n            lasse dot oorni at ludocraft dot com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

An example is a real object that visualizes its internal (non-visible) state overlaid on the real object using AR techniques. The user can then affect the real object by interacting with the virtual object using multi-touch gestures, which are relayed to the real object using services. Many of the necessary tools are available by the other topics in this GE (e.g. presentation of overlaid content, services to modify the state of the UI, services calls initiated from UI components). This higher-level GE deals with defining the aspects necessary to put them together and provide any necessary missing components and glue them together. \n\n Why to get it \n\nReal Virtual Interaction generic enabler (GE) provides means for connecting real world devices consisting of sensors and actuators in to augmented or virtual reality applications. Since the real world sensors and actuators are not complex enough to contain necessary logic to publish themselves outside their immediate domain there needs to be a external service that is able to access these devices and to be able to share the access to other services and also directly to end-users. This service provides security, data base for storing history and offline data, scalability and other cloud-like features that make it easier for application and service developers to make use of the devices in various purposes. This GE also provides a practical prototype for publishing sensor and actuator information application developers derived from NGSI 9/10 format developed earlier in FIWARE. \n\n Open specification reference \nThis component has been designed according the  Real Virtual Interaction GE Open Specification .

A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\u201cRealVirtualInteractionGE\u201d -image contains preconfigured setup for Real Virtual Interaction GE. Setup contains precompiled RvI server and test client which can be used while RvI server is on simulation mode. Further details of RvI usage in the  documentation .\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nReal virtual interaction GE can be installed to Chef virtual instance by using \u201cRealVirtualInteractionGE 4.4.3\u201d -recipe.

The Identity Manager is the central component that provides a bridge between IdM systems at connectivity-level and application-level.\n\nFurthermore, Identity Management is used for authorising foreign services to access personal data stored in a secure environment. Hereby usually the owner of the data must give consent to access the data; the consent-giving procedure also implies certain user authentication.\n\n\n Why to Get it \nIdentity Management is key on any architecture. IdM offers tools for administrators to support the handling of user life-cycle functions. It reduces the effort for account creation and management, as it supports the enforcement of policies and procedures for user registration, user profile management and the modification of user accounts. Administrators can quickly configure customized pages for the inclusion of different authentication providers, registration of tenant applications with access to user profile data and the handling of error notifications. For end users, the IdM provides a convenient solution for registering with applications since it gives them a means to re-use attributes like address, email or others, thus allowing an easy and convenient management of profile information. Users and administrators can rely on standardised solutions to allow user self-service features.\n \nAs it is possible to configure several applications that shall be linked to his IdM, the main benefit for users is a single sign-on (SSO) to all these applications. The IdM offers hosted user profile storage with specific user profile attributes. Applications do not have to run and manage their own persistent user data storages, but instead, can use the IdM user profile storage as a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering.\n\n Open Specification Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Identity Management Specification Keyrock is an implementation of the FIWARE  Identity Management  Generic Enabler.

Using these interfaces, clients can do several operations:\n\n \n Register context producer applications, e.g. a temperature sensor within a room \n Update context information, e.g. send updates of temperature \n Being notified when changes on context information take place (e.g. the temperature has changed) or with a given frequency (e.g. get the temperature each minute)\n Query context information. The Orion Context Broker stores context information updated from applications, so queries are resolved based on that information.\n \n\nApart from Orion Context Broker, there are other related components that you may find useful, such as Cygnus or Steelskin PEP. Cygnus implements a connector for context data coming from Orion Context Broker and aimed to be stored in a specific persistent storage, such as HDFS, CKAN or MySQL. Steelskin PEP is a proxy meant to secure Orion Context Broker, by intercepting every request sent to the Orion, validating it against the Access Control component.\n\n Why you get \n\nIf you are developing a Data/Context scenario, a broker like the Orion Context Broker is a must. You would need a component in the architecture able to mediate between consumer producers (e.g. sensors) and the context consumer applications (e.g. an smartphone applications taking advantage of the context information provided by the sensors). The Orion Context Broker fulfils this functionality in your architecture.\n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Publish/Subscribe Context Broker GE Open Specification Orion is an implementation of the FIWARE Publish/Subscribe Context Broker Generic Enabler.\n\nMore specifically, Orion implements the following APIs and Open Specifications:\n\n \n NGSIv1 API \n \n Send feedback \n\n\n\n \n       Label:\u00a0 \n     \n           A++ \n       \n \n Efficency Description:\u00a0 \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Excellent \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very Good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       1900 updates/sec \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Under review, soon to be provided \n       - \n     \n   \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Publish/Subscribe Context Broker - Orion Context Broker", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       Latest      \n        Updated:       2016-12-09      \n        Contact Person:       Ask in Stack Overflow with tag fiware-orion      \n            -      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Excellent \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very Good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       1900 updates/sec \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Under review, soon to be provided \n       - \n     \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

It enables the abstraction and virtualization of network resources and functionalities. It offers a RESTful interface in order to get information about the network topology components and elements either real or virtual. OFNIC also monitors the status of the network and provides near real-time data about network statistics with different levels of granularity (flow, node, port). Moreover it is capable of controlling the network forwarding capabilities and thus it is able to establish end-to-end paths with given quality of service/experience (QoS/QoE) requirements between any two nodes in the network.\n\n Why to get \nA customer wants to transfer a big amount of data to a certain end-point in the network. The data is located at one or multiple locations in the network. To get the data fast enough for his needs and in a reliable way, the customer wants to establish paths with certain requirements between the locations where his data is going to be transferred. In order to establish these guaranteed connections, the customer provides to the OFNIC GEi the list of source and destination endpoints and receives the response regarding the establishment of the required paths. Later the customer can manage his paths by modifying or releasing them on the basis of his needs. After the setup of the required paths, the customer could be interested in the monitoring of their status(i.e. the customer could be interested in the degree of utilization of the paths, or in the error rate on them, etc.), and the customer will have access to a number of statistics about the paths.\n\nRegarding the market position a brief consideration can be done. In the software defined networks paradigms there are many solutions which provide various network controllers and the competition is very high. Despite of this, part of them succeed in providing a clear definition of the northbound interface. The northbound interface is the one that enables the communication of the controller with the applications world. Moreover the network which they control differs from one case to another offering different functionalities and thus also the API exposed is fragmented. The main advantage of the SDN paradigm is to bring together the network world with the applications world. OFNIC realization is based on the NetIC Open Specifications and thus application developed specifically for emerging Openflow networks can be deployed for other GEi that are installed on top of other networks but have been developed their interface in line with the NetIC Open specifications.\n\n Open Specifications \nOFNIC is an open source, reference implementation of the FIWARE  NetIC   Generic Enabler. More specifically, OFNIC implements the following APIs and Open Specifications related to Openflow networks controlling:\nSee  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.I2ND.NetIC  for more information about NetIC open specifications.\nSee  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.I2ND.NetIC.RESTfulAPI  for more information about NetIC open API specifications.\n\n\n IMPORTANT NOTE \nThis GE reference implementation product is only of interest to potential FIWARE instance providers and therefore has been used to build the basic FIWARE platform core infrastructure of the FIWARE Lab.   If you are an application developer, you don't need to create a complete FIWARE instance locally in order to start building applications based on FIWARE.   You may rely on instances of FIWARE GEris linked to the Data/Media Context Management chapter, the IoT Services Enablement chapter, the Advanced Web-based User Interface chapter or some GEris of the Applications/Services Ecosystem and Delivery Framework chapter (WireCloud) as well as the Security chapter (Access Control).   Those instances are either global instances or instances you can create on the FIWARE Lab but can also be instance you can create by means of downloading, installing and configuring the corresponding software in your own premises.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE PPP Testbed (available to FIWARE PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n\n \n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fiware.org)\n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name  orion-psb-image-R n  (where  n  is an image version number, such as 4.1).\n \n\nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\nNote that orion-psb-image-R n  include not only Orion Context Broker but also other useful software related with it, such as Cygnus, the Orion PEP proxy and Rush. The RPMs installed in the image could be older than the most recent ones at FIWARE RPM reposiory, so it is strongly recommended that you update to the latest versions (read the welcome message upon SSH login for details).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\nThe  Orion Context Broker  can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can go to the Instance tab and press the \u201cAdd software\u201d button to automatically install the GE (called  orion ) and additional software from the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to deploy software using recipes are available on a tutorial available on http://lab.fiware.org\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n\nThere may be Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates. The  orion-cb-sa  can be used as the basis for your own Blueprint Template or to extend the Blueprint Template you are defining for your own applications. The  orion-cb-sa  automates the deployment of a dedicated GE instance on top of several VMs via Chef recipes defined for  orion  in the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available from a tutorial available on http://lab.fiware.org\n\n Using the  Docker  container \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe Dockerfile can be found  here .\n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here .\n\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Publish/Subscribe Context Broker - Orion Context Broker", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       Latest      \n        Updated:       2016-12-09      \n        Contact Person:       Ask in Stack Overflow with tag fiware-orion      \n            -      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Excellent \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very Good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       1900 updates/sec \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Under review, soon to be provided \n       - \n     \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

At the heart of this enabler there is the Open API. A REST-like API, based on JSON RPC 2.0, exposing a toolbox of Media Elements that can be chained to create complex media processing pipelines.\n\nThe Stream Oriented GE provides several client implementations of the Open API. The Java client allows developers to include media capabilities to Java or JEE applications. There is also a Javascript client ready to be used with NodeJS or directly in browser applications.\n\nThanks to these, the Stream Oriented GE provides developers with a set of robust end-to-end interoperable multimedia communication capabilities to deal with the complexity of transport, encoding/decoding, processing and rendering tasks in an easy and efficient way. \n\n Why get it \n\nThe development of interactive multimedia applications is a complex task, which usually requires specific expertise and huge investments. Stream Oriented GE brings a number of abstractions and enablers democratizing multimedia technologies and making possible to any WWW developer to create powerful applications involving advanced features such as: interoperable audiovisual communications, computer vision, augmented reality, flexible media playing, recording, etc.\n\nThe Stream Oriented GE will be particularly useful and intuitive for developers familiar with Java EE and JavaScript technologies, although its capabilities are also exposed through agnostic interoperable network interfaces that can be consumed from any other language of system.\n\nIn a nutshell, It makes possible the development of complex interactive multimedia communications in a fast, simple and easy way.\n\n Open Specifications \n\nKurento is an implementation of the FIWARE  Stream Oriented Generic Enabler  .

The Cyber Security GE is planned to be release in R4 and as such a dedciated entry would be created on the FIWARE Catalog.\n \n\n What you get \n The Security Monitoring GE is part of the overall Security Management System in FI-WARE and as such is part of each and every FI-WARE instance.  \nThe Security Monitoring GE was designed to be offered as a services suite. The services provided, even if they can be used in isolation offer their most when used conjointly to cover the whole & primary usage pattern. Hereafter is the list of services offered by the Security Monitoring  \n \n MulVAL Attack Paths Engine \n Scored Attack Paths \n Remediation \n \n\n MulVAL Attack Paths Engine \nMulVAL Attack Paths Engine Component is an end-to-end framework and reasoning system that conducts multihost, multistage vulnerability analysis on a network.   MulVAL Attack Paths Engine is accessed using web browser, allowing all users  to generate the attack graphs using the common stream protocol and port (HTTP on port 80).\nAttack graph presents a qualitative view of security discrepancies:\n \n It shows what attacks are possible, but does not tell you how bad the problem is. \n It captures the interactions among all attack possibilities in your system. \n \n\n\n \n\n Scored Attack Paths \nScored Attack Paths represents the next step, following the metrics provided by the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine. Based on the Attack Graph provided by the Mulval Attack Paths Engine, and the individual scores of each step, the objective is to yield the possible attack paths, along with a score associated to each one of the paths.\n\nThe considered attack paths that will be included in the list are selected based on the target node selected in the attack graph. The score of each path reflects the risk associated to the path as a whole, based on the individual scores of each step that have been previously calculated by the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine.\n\nAdditionally to the risk score metric, the score of each path will include a second scoring component that will account for the impact on the processes linked to the IT resource(s) being either\n \n solely at the target node of the attack path \n on the attack path \n \n\nThe main idea of scoring attack paths is to consider paths independently from one another, as opposed to the approach of the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine, composed of individual scores, the latter being computed by taking into account all the connections existing in the attack graph. \n\n\n\n \n\n Remediation \nRemediation provides tools to security operators for proposing cost-sensitive remediations to attack paths.\n\nThe attack paths are shown to a security operator, ordered by their scores, which allow to easily understand the severity of the consequences of the attack paths. To calculate the remediation to the chosen attack path, the tool first extracts the necessary information from the attack path to be corrected. Then, it computes several lists of remediations that could reduce / cut this attack path. Finally, it estimates the cost of each list of remediations and proposes all the lists of remediations, ordered by cost, to security operators. Operators can choose one remediation list and, thanks to the remediation validation, check whether or not the system is more secure after the application of this remediation. \n\nTo compute remediations, a remediation database is needed. It will be external to the GE, as the vulnerability database. This database makes a connection between vulnerabilities (for example thanks to a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier - CVE ID) and a possible adapted remediation. Several types of remediation could be used, for example a patch (it corrects a vulnerability) or a signature of known attacks (it prevents the exploitation of a vulnerability). To build the remediation database, information about patches can be extracted from publicly available in Security Advisories (for example, coming from CERT-EU or the National Vulnerability Database). Information about signatures and the related vulnerability could be extracted from the signatures database that contains the CVE ID. The last type of remediation provided by the remediation tool can not be stored in the remediation database, because it is a topological remediation. This remediation is providing firewall rules that can prevent the intrusion of the attacker.\n\nTo sort the list of remediations, a cost function is applied to compute an estimate cost of each list. This cost contains two main components: operational costs and impact costs. The operational costs represent the costs caused by the deployment of the remediations, such as:\n\n \n Length of the deployment \n Maintenance \n Tests costs \n \n\nwhereas the impact costs represents the negative impact (side effects) that could happen following a remediation deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why to get it \n\nMulVAL Attack Paths Engine is contributing risk management of IT infrastructure.\n\nMuVAL Attack Paths Engine allows you  evaluating the security risk assessment, the potential attack paths and improves the capability to detect security breach and the cyber-resilience of infrastructures.\n\nThe Scored Attack Paths offers an assessment tool that allows users to obtain the attack paths existing in an attack graph, along with their respective individual scores. The score of each attack path allows to assess the risk value and business impact for the target associated to the attack path.\n\nThe Scored Attack Paths is aimed at users who want to either:\n\n \n Utilize the Remediation asset \n Evaluate the situation of their IT infrastructure from the security and business impact viewpoint \n Improve the security configurations through what-if analysis \n \n\nRemediation is aimed at users who want to either:\n\n \n Show attack paths to a security operator \n  Order attack paths by their scores \n Apply a cost function to compute an estimate cost of each list \n \n\n\n Open Specification reference \n\n The Open Specifications of the MulvAL Attack Paths Engine in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following links: \n Mulval Attack Paths Engine API Specification \n Mulval Attack Paths Engine  Web Application API Specification \n\n\n The Open Specification of the Scored Attack Paths in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following link: \n Scored Attack Paths API Specification \n\n The Open Specification of the Remediation in the context of the Security Monitoring GE can be found via the following link: \n Remediation API Specification \n\n Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Security Monitoring", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2015-09-02      \n        Contact Person:       Olivier Bettan / Susana Gonz\u00e1lez Zarzosa      \n            olivier.bettan@thalesgroup.com\nsusana.gzarzosa@atos.net      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).\n\nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n\nFor this particular generic enabler instance the available deployment methods are as follows:\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n\n \n   Access the  FIWARE Cloud Portal \n   Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on  FIWARE Account Portal ) \n   Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name \"keyrock-RX.Y\" \n \n\nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\nWilma can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can go to the Instance tab and press the \u201cAdd software\u201d button to automatically install the GE (called idm) and additional software from the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to deploy software using recipes are available on a tutorial available on  FIWARE Lab Portal \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe Dockerfile can be found  here \n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Identity Management - KeyRock", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       5.1      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Joaqu\u00edn Salvach\u00faa / \u00c1lvaro Alonso      \n            jsalvachua@dit.upm.es\naalonsog@dit.upm.es\n      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Good \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Good \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0,04 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       1,75 average bugs priority \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       9,9 days \n       B \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       2,6 days \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,03 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       324 authorization/authentication requests per second \n       B \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory/CPU are progressively increasing but no leak \n       A \n     \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

For the integration, you can save as this file in order to add value for your business.\n\n \n Manuals  \n  \n \n A high-level description of the overall architecture of the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Architecture Description \n\n The description of the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine provided in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  MulVAL Attack Paths Engine Description \n\n The provided API of the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine is specified in the  API Specification  and the Web Application is specified in the  Web Application API Specification \n\n The installation and administration guide of  MulVAL Attack Paths Engine is provided in the  Installation and Administration Guide  and the Web Application is provided in the  Web Application Installation and Administration Guide \n\n\n \n Tutorials       \n\n\n The user and programmer guide of MulVAL Attack Paths Engine is provided in the  User and Programmer Guide  and the Web Application is provided in the  Web Application User and Programmer Guide \n\n The tutorial to test the MulVAL Attack Paths Engine is provided in the  Unit Testing Plan  and the tutorial to test the Web Application is provided in the  Web Application Unit Testing Plan \n\n\n  Scored Attack Paths \n\n Quick reference guide \n\nThe scoring application provides tools to security operators for assessing the risk and impact of attack paths. This application is written in Java and has a client interface provided by Swing Java library. This quick guide explains how to use this application. \n\n \n Step 1 \n  \nThe main view contains the controls necessary for operating the application, setting the parameters, chosing the desired functions, and obtaining the attack path scores.\n\n \n Step 2 \n \nNext to the main control panel view, can be seen a tree view of the Attack Graph XML file. This view provides in a succint manner the details of the data format, allowing therefore to easily access the data related to a given vertex or an arc. \n\n \n Step 3 \n \nThe user inputs a new attack graph file, by clicking on the 'New input file to database'. An dialog opens for the MulVAL file selection, as depicted in the Figure below. \n \n\n \n Step 4 \n \nOnce the file has been selected, the user must load it by means of the 'Load current database' button. A dialog confirms whether the operation succeeded or failed\n\n \n Step 5 \n \nIf a file needs to be discarded, the database needs to be reinitialized. In order to do this, the user employs the 'Reset current database'.\n\n \n Step 6 \n \nAfter having input the MulVAL file, and loaded the XML database of the file, the user needs to select the normalization method, the score formula, and simply click on the 'Score' button.\n\n \n Manuals  \n  \n A high-level description of the overall architecture of the Scored Attack Paths in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Architecture Description \n The description of the Scored Attack Paths provided in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Scored Attack Paths Description \n\n The provided API of the Scored Attack Paths is specified in the  API Specification \n The installation and administration guide of Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  Installation and Administration Guide \n\n\n \n Tutorials       \n\n\n The user and programmer guide of Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  User and Programmer Guide \n The tutorial to test the Scored Attack Paths is provided in the  Unit Testing Plan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Remediation \n\n Quick reference guide \n\nThe remediation application provides tools to security operators for proposing cost-sensitive remediations to attack paths. This application is written in Java and has a web-interface provided by the Vaadin library. This quick guide explains how to use this web application. \n\n \n Step 1 \n  \nAttack path view:\n\nThe main view contains a representation of the attack path to correct. The first attack path printed is the first ranked (according to the attack paths ranking function). The user can choose another attack path to print in a combo box. The vertices of the attack path have different colours, according to the type of vertex (OR, AND, LEAF or GOAL). The labels of the vertices explain the type of action made by the attacker. A more detailed caption can be found by clicking the \"Show caption\" button under the attack path view. \n\n \n Step 2 \n \nAttack path topologic view:\n\nNext to the attack path view, can be seen a more abstracted and topologic view of the attack path. This view show the different access made by the attacker accross the information system during the attack. This view also show the target machine of the attack and all the compromised machines.\n\n \n Step 3 \n \nRemediation choice:\n\nOn the bottom of the GUI, the security operator can choice several sets of remediation that can correct the attack path. The remediation set with the lower cost is chosen by default, but the operator can choose another one with the appropriate combo-box. To simulate the application of a remediation and its effects on the attack path, the operator can click on the related checkbox and then reset the applied remediations with the button \"Reset remediations\".\n \n \n Manuals  \n  \n A high-level description of the overall architecture of the Remediation in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Architecture Description \n The description of the Remediation provided in the Security Monitoring GE is available at the  Remediation Description \n The provided API of the Remediation is specified in the  API Specification \n The installation and administration guide of the Remediation is provided in the  Installation and Administration Guide \n\n\n \n Tutorials       \n\n\n The user and programmer guide of the Remediation is provided in the  User and Programmer Guide \n The tutorial to test the Remediation is provided in the  Unit Testing Plan \n\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Security Monitoring", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2015-09-02      \n        Contact Person:       Olivier Bettan / Susana Gonz\u00e1lez Zarzosa      \n            olivier.bettan@thalesgroup.com\nsusana.gzarzosa@atos.net      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FI-LAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n MulVAL Attack Paths Engine, Scored Attack Paths and Remediation \nThese three GEis are hoisted in the same VM instance. In order to deploy a dedicated instance of these GEi perform the following actions:\n \n Access the FI-WARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fi-ware.org) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fi-ware.org) \n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name  SecMonitoring-GE-AttackGraph-Scoring-Remediation-Thales-3.3.3 \n \nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of these GEis will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FI-WARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FI-WARE Cloud).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n MulVAL Attack Paths Engine, Scored Attack Paths and Remediation \nAs these three applications are offered in the same VM instance and can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can go to the Instance tab and press the \u201cAdd software\u201d button to automatically install the GE (with the cookbook called  sls ) and additional software from the software catalogue.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FI-LAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nThere are no images created for this GE implementation yet.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nFiVES is available as Chef recipe that is also installed on the FIWARE chef server. The recipe is available for Ubuntu 12.04, 14.0 and CentOS 7. Please browser the FIWARE software catalogue for the recipe \"5.1.1 fives\". The VM on which your instance is deploy needs to have port 22 open for SSH, 8081 and 8181 for HTTP connections to the FiVES server, and 34837 for the WebSocket realtime communication.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nFiVES is also available as Blueprint Template in the FIWARE Catalogue. Please refer to the bullet point above for the ports that FiVES is using.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE PPP Testbed (available to FIWARE PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are four basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n Deploying a Docker container.  There will be a Docker container that will allow to deploy the GE using Docker \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nThere are no images created for this GE implementation.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation.\n Using the Docker container \nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FILAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\u201c2D3DCapture\u201d -image contains preconfigured setup for 2D3D Capture GE. Setup contains Tomcat installation and automatic port change to 9090. After image is deployed, 2D3D test cases can be accessed via http:// 9090/TwoDThreeDCapture/.\nFurther details of the usage in  http://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/2D-3D_Capture_-_User_and_Programmers_Guide \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n2D3D Capture GE can be installed to Chef virtual instance by using \u201c2D3DCapture 3.3.3\u201d-recipe. Recipe installs all needed components to run 2D3D capture on VM.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n\u201c2D3DCapture\u201d blueprint can be used for GE deployment, it uses \u201c2D3D Capture 3.3.3\u201d recipe for GE setup.    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "2D/3D Capture", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       3.2.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-31      \n        Contact Person:       Cyberlightning      \n            contact@cyberlightning.com      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n3D-UI-XML3D is provided by the following image in FIWARE Lab:\n \n XML3D Image \n \nThis image contains an HTTP server that listens on port 80, with xml3d.js and a set of examples deployed. xml3d.js will be accessible under the path http://[$YOUR_IP]/xml3d.js . The set of examples is provided ad http://[$YOUR_IP]/xml3d_examples\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nXML3D can also be installed on your own infrastructure using the chef recipe xml3d 5.1.1 .\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere is also a Blueprint template available for 3D-UI-XML3D:\n \n  XML3D Blueprint  \n \n\nInstalling this template on your VM results in the same configuration as for the XML3D image.    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "3D-UI-XML3D", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       5.1.1      \n        Updated:       2016-04-28      \n        Contact Person:       Christian Schlinkmann      \n            Email: xml3d-public@cg.uni-saarland.de      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The GE implementation is based on open source Geoserver project (GPL licenced) and W3DS extension.\n\nUsing the GE consists of two phases. \n \n  Import the geodata into the GIS database into selected layer structure\n  serve the data from the imported layers as client requests\n \n\nGIS GE does not restrict the layerstucture nor the datatypes what is being imported into the database. Hence, the GE does not provide import tools universally for all dataformats in the world. As a reference, a dataset from Finnish geographical institute is provided to show how geodata is imported. Using this example it is easy to extend the import process to any dataset you might possess.\n\n Why to get it \n\"3D GIS (Geographic Information System) data provider\" is a GE, which is able to serve both outdoor and indoor 3D data. The data shall be served roughly speaking in two fashions:\n \n For single user apps, which can make queries to GIS backend, to download specific a single object, or a set of geolocated 3D objects (i.e. building and terrain model of a named city centre)\n For multiuser apps, which communicate via collaborative client platform (realXTend) and in which case the realXtend is providing the 3D models for the client application. \n \nThe GIS GE itself will be build of a server, which is able to process geolocated queries, an extension to it which is able to manage 3D data and a backend database where all geolocated data is saved. Because the GIS GE needs to serve both single user client apps (browsers) and multiuser enabled virtual spaces, an API will be defined to serve fluently both of the cases. In this API is a RESTful one, and allows both the browser app as well as realXtend virtual world platform to use it for downloading geolocated data. Overall, this GE is a simpel way of hosting 3D geographical data for your application.

This editor in particular utilizes Scene and EC model, in other words, manipulates entities, components and attributes. Manipulations can be done through GUI that consist of three parts: scene tree, EC editor, and additional toolbar, or directly into the scene via 3D manipulation helper objects such as transform gizmo / axis tripods, and grids. The GUI provides extensive editing of entities that cannot be otherwise done via a 3D manipulation helper, and also in most of the cases serves for fine-tuning of values. \n\n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Interface designer open specification The open specification provides detailed technical information about the implementation of the GE.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).\n\nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n\nFor this particular generic enabler instance the available deployment methods are as follows:\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n\n \n   Access the  FIWARE Cloud Portal \n   Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on  FIWARE Account Portal ) \n   Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name \"pep-proxy-image\" \n \n\nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\nWilma can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can go to the Instance tab and press the \u201cAdd software\u201d button to automatically install the GE (called pep-proxy) and additional software from the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to deploy software using recipes are available on a tutorial available on  FIWARE Lab Portal \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe Dockerfile can be found  here \n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "PEP Proxy - Wilma", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Alvaro Alonso      \n            aalonsog@dit.upm.es      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n Wilma \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       2,3 days \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       10 days \n       A \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       1126,25 proxy requests per second \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory/CPU keep stable  \n       A+++ \n     \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nYou can follow these steps to get a ready-to-use and readily configured instance of this GE:\n \n Login to http://cloud.lab.fiware.org with your credentials \n Create a security group under the \"Security\" section, and open port number 22 (for SSH access if wanted) and port number 80 for both TCP and UDP; \n Navigate to \"Images\" and select \"InterfaceDesigner-X.X.X\", where X.X.X stands for version number (for example 4.4.3). Click on \"Launch\"; \n In step 2 of the \"Launch Instances\" window called \"Access & Security\", be sure to check your new created security group when creating the instance. \n Finish creating the instance, no further custom options are required; \n The instance will appear in the \"Instances\" section. Please wait until the \"Status\" column shows \"ACTIVE\", the \"Task\" column shows \"none\", and \"Power state\" is \"RUNNING\"; \n Attach a floating IP address in the \"Security\" section, so you can access it from anywhere on the internet. \n \nYour instance is now ready to use.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n Using a Docker container \nA Docker container can be used to run your own instance.

There's also test functions for the elevation data queries in octet-stream response form.\n \n4 example client can be accessed from the above main page:\n \n  XML3D object example client\n \n Example client creates queries which response is 3D object definition of the queried terrain area. Client places received XML3D definition directly to the DOM tree, which leads rendering terrain object to the display.\n \n \n \n \n\n \n  Octet-stream example client\n \n Example client queries elevation data which response format is octet-stream.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FILAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customized options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nGIS GE can be deployed by initiating  GIS  -image. Image contains Geoserver with W3DS module and test content. GIS test client is also included in the image. After image is launched, Geoserver can be accessed via  http:// :8080/geoserver . Test client can be accessed via  http:// :8080/gis_test_client .\nAfter successfully launching \u201cGIS\u201d -image, Geoserver needs to be configured to use provided test asset. Provided test asset can be found under Geoserver installation in folder:  FIWARE-test_asset/ . Folder can be accessed via Geoserver admin panel, store definitions are done under  Data/Stores  -section.  More detailed installation instructions are described in documentation   (please follow naming examples). When Geoserver is configured to use provided test asset, test client can be used to access test data.\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nGIS GE can be installed to Chef virtual instance by using  GIS 4.4.3  -recipe. Test asset setup is same as described in \u201cDeploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image\u201d -section\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nGIS GE can be installed to Chef virtual instance by using  GIS  -Blueprint. Test asset setup is same as described in \u201cDeploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image\u201d -section\n\n Using the  Docker  container \nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance. The Dockerfile can be found  here . The DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here .\n\nTest asset setup is same as described in \u201cDeploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image\u201d -section\n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "GIS Data Provider - Geoserver/3D", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:       1.0      \n        Updated:       2016-04-27      \n        Contact Person:       Cyberlightning      \n            contact@cyberlightning.com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

It is easy to use by just taking the release and using the Javascript code as normally in Web development. However the C++ written Tundra server from the Synchronization GE is required as well as the counterpart.\n\nInstead of installing the library manually you may want to choose automated deployment facilities provided in the FI-WARE Cloud environment you are using.  The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FI-LAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nThe image is available in the FIWARE Lab catalogue.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThe recipe is available in the FIWARE Lab catalogue.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThe blueprint template is available in the FIWARE Lab catalogue.\n Using a Docker container \nA Docker container can be used to run your own instance. The Dockerfile can be found  here .

But this is a chronophage and repetitive operation ad eternum. Opposite to it, Pegasus provides the following advantages:\n \n Cost savings \nThis component helps improve the efficiency of IT resources and processes that form part of application delivery in any enterprise. Pegasus facilitates the creation of applications and services without the complexity and cost of provisioning the required resources and the management of the traditional application platform stack. Just in a few minutes you can use your applications without have to any infrastructure or configure operation over the needed resources.\n Faster delivery of applications \nPegasus increases the benefits of Agile Software Development methodologies through the reduction of expended time to deliver software application projects. The architecture of your application is defined once and reused each time that you need to deliver the applications.\n Increased adaptability \nPegasus reduces the architectural complexity and allows adapting the applications and IT services to answer quickly to new conditions market and organization changes.

As part of the complete process of deployment of applications, the aim of Sagitta is to deploy software product instances upon request of the user using the API or through the Cloud Portal. \n\n The steps to install a product are described in form of recipes that indicates how the software (such as Apache Tomcat, MySQL, or HAProxy) has to be deployed. The recipes describe a series of resources that should be configured to start running in a particular state: packages that should be installed, services that should be running, or files that should be copied. Sagitta makes sure each resource is properly configured, and provides a safe, flexible, easily-repeatable mechanism that ensures all the nodes are always running exactly the way they were expected. Recipes belonging to a single product are aggregated in a cookbook for that product, which is stored and managed by Sagitta framework. \n\n All the available recipes needed for the management of a given product are aggregated in a cookbook following a naming convention. Every product supported by Sagitta must have a cookbook with all the required recipes. Some instructions about how to build cookbooks and recipes can be found in  \"Recipes for GEs\" . \n\n IMPORTANT NOTE: This GE reference implementation product is only of interest to potential FIWARE instance providers and therefore has been used to build the basic FIWARE platform core infrastructure of the FIWARE Lab.

This middleware prevent installation of your products in repetitive sequence step, providing the following advantages: \n \n Accelerate your Time to Market \nYou only need to define the recipe that you use once. Afterward, you only need to use it each that you want to install your product. Additionally, you will be ready to deploy new features on your products in minutes rather than days. \n Increase agility and efficiency \nAll the repetitive tasks that you need to do in order to install your products will be automated. Your developer team will not need to cope with IT infrastructure requirements. You give them the recipe or recipes that they have to use and you obtain developers ready to go in just a few minutes.\n Consistency \nForget the problem that your developers are using different environment with different tools.

For the moment it consist of open source implementation of a User Portal and Scripts. The User Portal is implemented in a form of a Web GUI following the same functionality as the OpenStack Dashboard. All about the implementation and the functionality of the OpenStack Dashboard can be found under the Horizon project. The Scripts facilitate direct approach to the underlying cloud resources through a command line and is addressed for administrators.\n\n Why to Get it \nThe Self Services Interfaces is divided in two parts: User Portal and Toolkit.\n \n The User Portal is implemented in a form of a Web GUI following the example of the portals that today's common cloud infrastructure managers like Amazon EC2, Eucalyptus,Cloud Sigma, Rackspace, etc. have. In concrete it bases its design principles on the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard. The basic objective of the user portal is to facilitate the user of the cloud perform operations over the underlying infrastructure. This includes perform actions such as: create user, manage projects, lunch instances on a base of images, create images in the image repository, retrieve flavors from the resource, etc. Moreover the portal facilitates management of a Virtual Data centers (VDCs), Services and Service Data Centers (SDCs), PaaS management and will offer monitoring statistics of the physical and virtual machines. \n The Toolkit is aimed for administrators and experienced users and it consist of various scripts that permit to perform the same actions the user portal does and some more advanced options. \n \n\n Open Specification \n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Self Service Interfaces Cloud Portal is an implementation of the FIWARE  Self Service Interfaces  Generic Enabler.

Policy Manager is an easy rule engine designed to be used in the OpenStack ecosystem and of course inside the FIWARE Cloud.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This GE reference implementation product is only of interest to potential FIWARE instance providers and therefore has been used to build the basic FIWARE platform core infrastructure of the FIWARE Lab. If you are an application developer, you don't need to create a complete FIWARE instance locally in order to start building applications based on FIWARE. You may rely on instances of FIWARE GEris linked to the Data/Media Context Management chapter, the IoT Services Enablement chapter, the Advanced Web-based User Interface chapter or some GEris of the Applications/Services Ecosystem and Delivery Framework chapter (WireCloud) as well as the Security chapter (Access Control). Those instances are either global instances or instances you can create on the FIWARE Lab but can also be instance you can create by means of downloading, installing and configuring the corresponding software in your own premises.\u00a0\n\n \n Why to get it \nOpenStack is an amazing open source software to manage the available infrastructure provided. Nevertheless, there is a lack related to the management of actions related to the monitoring data. Cloud administrator should make lots of forensic activities due to infrastructure or software problems that might be automatically resolved if an appropriate monitoring information should be received on time. This problem means a chronophage both cloud administrators and cloud users with the consequent money losses and credibility of the cloud solution. Policy Manager resolve this issue by defining a set of rules associated to the monitoring facts in order that cloud administrator does not lose their time on some forensic activities.\n\nBy using Policy Manager you have access to the following key features:\n \n Innovate through experimentation by choosing the best suited rule engine, rule definition and high architecture solution to manage high reception of facts in real time. \n Rules management whose target is to hire rules defined by the cloud administrator and/or cloud user. \n Populate rule engine with facts collected from the data context. \n Facts management related to servers and/or hosts. \n Rules evaluation on real time. \n \n Open Specifications \n\n Policy Manager is an open source, reference implementation of the  FIWARE Scalability Manager Generic Enabler . More specifically, Policy Manager implements the following  Open Specification API  related to the management of facts and actions. \n\n See  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Cloud.PolicyManager  for more information on the Policy Manager Open Specification.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n\nIn any case, the Scalability Manager GE - Policy Manager requires a complete OpenStack deployment together with the installation of the Monitoring GE and so instances cannot be created on demand. Instead, a multi-tenant instance of the Scalability Manager GE - Policy Manager is now installed and accessible on FIWARE Lab. These instances are available for use. Alternatively, to create an instance on your own infrastructure, please see the Installation and Administration guide under the Documentation tab.\n\n Using the  Docker  container  \nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\nThe Dockerfile for subcomponent bosun-cloto can be found  here  and the one for bosun-facts  here .\nThe DockerHub pages for this GE implementation can be found  here  for cloto and  here  for facts.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nThere are no images created for this GE implementation.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation.\n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Policy Manager - Bosun", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Cloud Hosting      \n        Version:       5.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-11-04      \n        Contact Person:       Fernando Lopez      \n            fernando dot lopezaguilar at telefonica dot com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n Bosun \n \n \n   \n     criteria \n     value \n     label \n   \n \n \n   \n     The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n   \n \n \n   \n     Documentation completeness \n     Fair \n     A \n   \n   \n     Documentation soundness \n     Good \n     A+ \n   \n   \n     APIs Failure Rate \n     0,06 tests failed/executed \n     A++ \n   \n   \n     Detected defects by Priority \n     1 average bugs priority \n     A++ \n   \n   \n     Time to respond issues \n     < 1 day \n     A+++ \n   \n   \n     Time to fix issues \n     1 day \n     A++ \n   \n   \n     Scalability \n     1,02 response time/thread number \n     A+++ \n   \n   \n     Performance \n     200 updates/sec \n     A+++ \n   \n   \n     Stability \n     Memory leak avoidable by configuration \n     B \n   \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).\n\nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n\nFor this particular generic enabler instance the available deployment methods are as follows:\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n\n \n   Access the  FIWARE Cloud Portal \n   Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on  FIWARE Account Portal ) \n   Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name \"cloud-portal-image\" \n \n\nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\nWilma can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can go to the Instance tab and press the \u201cAdd software\u201d button to automatically install the GE (called cloud-portal) and additional software from the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to deploy software using recipes are available on a tutorial available on  FIWARE Lab Portal \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe Dockerfile can be found  here \n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Self Service Interfaces - Cloud Portal", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Cloud Hosting      \n        Version:       5.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-02      \n        Contact Person:       \u00c1lvaro Alonso      \n            aalonsog@dit.upm.es      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer). \n\n There are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available: \n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\n In order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEri perform the following actions: \n \n     Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n     Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on https://account.lab.fiware.org) \n     Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name  wirecloud-image-RX.Y . \n \n\n In a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEri will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud). \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\n Wirecloud GEri can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can use the chef client to automatically install the GEri (called wirecloud) and additional software from the software catalogue. \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n\n There are Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates in the FIWARE Lab Cloud. To deploy this GEri using the available blueprint perform the following actions: \n\n \n     Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n     Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on https://account.lab.fiware.org) \n     Click on the \"Blueprint Templates\" option at the left \n     Click on the \"Open Catalog\" option. \n     Clone the template called \"Wirecloud\" \n     Configure the tiers of the blueprint with your security keys \n     Launch the template \n \n\n The instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available from a tutorial available on http://help.lab.fiware.org \n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\n This GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance. \n\n The Dockerfiles can be found  here \n\n The DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Application Mashup - Wirecloud", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       5.4.1      \n        Updated:       2016-10-13      \n        Contact Person:       Javier Soriano (UPM)      \n            \nDr. Javier Soriano (jsoriano@fi.upm.es) \nSchool of Computer Science\nUniversidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid\nCampus de Montegancedo s/n\n28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)\n \n\n Technical questions can be asked in  StackOverflow  using the  fiware-wirecloud  tag      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The functionality provided by the FIWARE Business Framework will be offered by the new Business API Ecosystem GE, which will be released in the release 5 of FIWARE \n\n What you get \n\nWMarket provides functionality necessary for bringing together offering and demand for making business. These functions include basic services for registering business entities, publishing and retrieving offerings and demands, search and discover offerings according to specific consumer requirements as well as lateral functions like review, rating and recommendation. Besides the core functions, the Marketplace may offer value because of its \"knowledge\" about the market in terms of market intelligence services, pricing support, advertising, information subscription and more.\n\n\n Why to get it \n\nThe core functionality of the  WMarket  is to provide you a uniform service interface to discover and match application and service offerings from providers and sources (e.g. published by different stores) with demand of consumers.\nThis core functionality provides a basis for extended services depending on the domain and nature of the target markets. \n\n\n Open Specification Reference \n\n \nThe Open Specification of the GE can be found in the \n FIWARE Wiki \n \n\n \nThe Open RESTful API specification can be found at  Apiary \n Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Marketplace - WMarket", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       4.4.5      \n        Updated:       2016-09-27      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            fdelavega@conwet.com      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The functionality provided by the FIWARE Business Framework will be offered by the new Business API Ecosystem GE, which will be released in the release 5 of FIWARE \n\n What you get \n\n Service Business Frameworks (SBFs) represent one of the cornerstones of service ecosystems. The key objective of a SBF is to build and support an ecosystem of applications and services that is sustainable and fosters innovation as well as cross-fertilization. In particular, it consists of a number of interrelated components that support managing services in the business framework across the whole service lifecycle: from creation and composition of services to monetization and revenue sharing.  \n\n One key component of the SBF provided by FI-WARE is a Store for selling services to both consumers and developers of Future Internet applications and services and for end-to-end managing of offerings and sales. \n\n While a marketplace is a platform for many stores to place their offerings to a broader audience and consumers to search and compare services and find the store where to buy, a store is owned by a store owner who has full control over a specific service/app portfolio and offerings. The final business transaction (buying) is done at the store and the whole back office process (end-to-end managing of offerings and sales) is handled by the store. \n\n By using the WStore GEri you have access to the following key features: \n \n Support for accounting callbacks \n Support for rich pricing models (including pricing parts for service compositions, composite apps and mashups, pay-per-use modalities, etc.) \n Support for charging \n Support for billing \n Support for revenue sharing \n Integrated support for PayPal \n Support for the FIWARE Marketplace, Repository and Revenue Sharing GEs \n Support for the linked-USDL standard \n Integrated with the WireCloud GEri by design  \n \n\n Note:  The Business Framework in general, and the WStore GEri in particular, are at the core of the FIWARE infrastructure and are therefore intended to be installed by FIWARE platform providers when setting up and configuring a new instance of the FIWARE instance node. They are not intended to be deployed/configured by a developer. Developers are encouraged to use  the global instance of the WStore provided in the FIWARE Lab . Nevertheless, we provide an installer for stand-alone instances of the WStore, along with recipes and blueprints to install it in the Cloud portal (using the PaaS Manager), and the corresponding installation guides. \n\n Why to get it \n\n The design of the Store generic enabler does not focus on consumer-centric mobile apps, but on selling enterprise-level apps and cloud services that will leverage the FIWARE platform in general and its business framework in particular. Its integrated support for pricing (including pay-per-use modalities), accounting, charging, billing and revenue sharing will position it one step ahead of the current market. \n\n Open Specifications \n\nWStore is an open source, reference implementation of the FIWARE  Store  Generic Enabler. More specifically, WStore implements the following APIs and Open Specifications related to the FIWARE Business Framework: \n \n See  FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Apps.Store  for more information on the Store Open Specification. \n See  Store API  for a detailed description of the Store Open RESTful API Specification \n Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Store - WStore", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       4.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-09-27      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            Email: \nfdelavega@fi.upm.es\n\nAddress:\nSchool of Computer Science\nUniversidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid\nCampus de Montegancedo s/n\n28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The functionality provided by the FIWARE Business Framework will be offered by the new Business API Ecosystem GE, which will be released in the release 5 of FIWARE \n\n What you get \n\n The Revenue Settlement and Sharing System (RSS) GE is in charge of distributing the revenues originated by the usage of a given service among the involved stakeholders. In particular, it focuses on distributing part of the revenue generated by a service between the Store Provider and the Service Provider(s) responsible for the service. With the term \"service\" we refer to both final applications and backend application services (typically exposed through an API). Note that, in the case of composite services, more than one service provider may have to receive a share of the revenues. \n\n Revenue sharing is based on a set of business models (revenue sharing models) which dictate how to distribute revenues. The RSS GE is fed, via available APIs, with these models and additional information regarding service providers. In addition, Charging Data Records (CDRs), based on service usage information, are periodically fed to the RSS GE to enable the revenue sharing process. CDRs must be created by another GE (e.g., the Store GE) and/or external system based on per service specified price models and accounting information.  \n\n Different revenue sharing models can be assigned to Service Providers, each of them based on a combination of parameters such as product class or the Store that offers the service. For instance, the revenue sharing model used to calculate payments to a given Service Provider for music may be different from the one used for applications.   \n\n The RSS GE exposes an API for other components to send charging information and to manage revenue sharing models. It also features a GUI which can be used by RSS and Store administrators to manage revenue sharing models, access reporting information and perform additional administration tasks.  \n\n Additionally to this functionality the RSS GE offers the possibility to consult reports, regarding the CDR received, to both RSS and Store administrators. Example of these reports can be the quantity of amounts received in a period, number of transactions per application provider, or information regarding the most purchased applications. \n\n Finally as a supplementary functionality, expenditure limits functionality is offered in this GE. The expenditure limit API provides a mechanism through which an application provider can limit the amount of money spent by a customer using the services, along a specific time interval. Once this limit is exceeded, it will not be possible to purchase anything until next period of time.  \n\n This API exposes the functionality that a provider will use to check the balance and accumulated expenses of a given customer, previously to accept a purchase.  \n\n The RSS GE is part of FIWARE's Business Framework and thus can work in close cooperation with other GEs like the Store GE. However, it can also work in a standalone way. \n\nMain capabilities offered include:\n \n Storage of trading transactions \n Definition of revenue sharing models \n Revenue settlement \n Revenue reporting capabilities \n Expenditure control management \n \n\nFor more details, see:  RSS GE description  \n\n Why to get it \n\n The RSS GE offers advanced revenue management capabilities which enable the proper monetization of your applications and services. Together with the rest of the FIWARE's business framework GEs, it creates a powerful trading environment which will help you reach and interact with a large amount of customers while requiring very little effort from your side. In addition, sophisticated analytics and reporting tools will help you better understand customers behaviour and business trends.

They are not intended to be deployed/configured by a developer. Developers are encouraged to use the global instance of the WStore provided in the FIWARE Lab. Nevertheless, we provide an installer for stand-alone instances of the WStore, along with recipes and blueprints to install it in the Cloud portal (using the PaaS Manager), and the corresponding installation guides. \n\n To manually create an instance on your own infrastructure, please see the Installation and Administration guide under the Documentation tab. \n\n There are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available: \n\n \n     Images.  A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n     Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.  There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n     Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications.\n \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\n In order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEri perform the following actions: \n\n \n     Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n     Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on https://account.lab.fiware.org) \n     Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name wstore-img. \n \n\n In a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEri will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud). \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\n WStore GEri can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can use the chef client  to automatically install the GEri (called wstore) and additional software from the software catalogue. \n\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n\n There are Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates in the FIWARE Lab Cloud. To deploy this GEri using the available blueprint perform the following actions: \n\n \n     Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n     Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on https://account.lab.fiware.org) \n     Click on the \"Blueprint Templates\" option at the left \n     Click on the \"Open Catalog\" option. \n     Clone the template called \"wstore\" \n     Configure the tiers of the blueprint with your security keys \n     Launch the template \n \n\n The instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available from a tutorial available on http://help.lab.fiware.org \n\n Using the Docker container \nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance. The Dockerfile can be found  here .

For example, it is possible to prove to the authenticating party that you have a valid credential without revealing it. Or that the name on the credential is the same as the name on your passport, again without revealing the name on the passport.\n\nThe GEri consists of three RESTful services:\n\n \n   The issuer service, which issues credentials. This needs to be deployed only once. \n   The verifier service, which issues presentation policies and which verifies that presentation tokens comply with those policies. This needs to be deployed once per resource owner. \n   The user service,  which connects to both issuers and verifiers and which computes presentation tokens from credentials and presentation policies. Needs to be deployed once per user. \n \n\nRead more about the Privacy GE in this  readme .\n\n Why to get it \n\nIf you run a service that is open only to authenticated users, but where you don't need a user's full identity every time they access your service or your resources, this GE may be for you. If you view the increasing number of break-ins and thefts of customer databases from major retailers with growing unease, this GE may be a profitable part of your strategy to curtail the value of such thefts. If you agree that the only way to prevent the misuse of large databases is not to have the data in the first place, but if you still want to make sure that users of your services are properly authenticated, this GE may be for you.\n\n Open Specification Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Privacy GE Open Specification Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Privacy", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       4.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-02      \n        Contact Person:       Stephan Neuhaus      \n            stephan.neuhaus@zhaw.ch      \n            Incubated GEs/GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Privacy GE Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nThe image  authzforce-5.4.1  is available from the FIWARE Lab Cloud Portal for deploying a dedicated GE instance.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation.\n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe latest Dockerfile can be found on  Github .\n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found in  FIWARE Docker hub repositories .    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Authorization PDP - AuthZForce", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       5.4.1      \n        Updated:       2017-02-14      \n        Contact Person:       Cyril DANGERVILLE      \n            Contact \n (function(){var qs,js,q,s,d=document,gi=d.getElementById,ce=d.createElement,gt=d.getElementsByTagName,id='typef_orm',b='https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/share.typeform.com/';if(!gi.call(d,id)){js=ce.call(d,'script');js.id=id;js.src=b+'share.js';q=gt.call(d,'script')[0];q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q)}})() \n\n      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n AuthZForce \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       9,2 days \n       A \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       9 days \n       A \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,15 response time/thread number \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       6853,58 authorization requests per second \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory/CPU are progressively increasing but no leak \n       A \n     \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nThere are no images created for this GE implementation yet.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe Dockerfile for the Issuer can be found  here ; the Dockerfile for the Verifier can be found  here ; and the Dockerfile for the User service can be found  here .\n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Privacy", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       4.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-08-02      \n        Contact Person:       Stephan Neuhaus      \n            stephan.neuhaus@zhaw.ch      \n            Incubated GEs/GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Privacy GE Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

Frequently implemented features include filtering, aggregating and merging real-time data from different sources. Thanks to Complex Event Processing (CEP), it is easy for applications to only subscribe to value-added data which is relevant to them. CEP technology is sometimes also referred to as event stream analysis, or real time event correlation.\n \n\n \n   Cepheus  is divided in two simple deployable applications. The first one is a light NGSI broker which features an implementation of  the standardized NGSI API . And a CEP which features a dedicated REST management API to configure real time analysis on NGSI events. \n \n\n \n  More information can be found  on the github page. \n \n\nRelated assets\n \n   \n     Esper (by EsperTech) library      \n   \n \n Why to get it \n \n  IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE is designed to provide a common access in real time to all data, for any kind of sensors and \"Things\". Using a lightweight storage system, this enabler can save and locally store relevant processed data, as close as possible possible to the processed entities. It targets IoT gateways and embedded systems.\n \n \n  IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE is the first stage of intelligence, filtering and aggregating sensor events thanks to smart but simple rules. It collects NGSI data in real-time from compliant IoT protocol adapters, transform them to value-added application relevant events, then finally propagate them towards the subscribers. Subscribed applications are now able to collect filtered-relevant real-time data, thus externalizing the responsibility for dedicated development of asynchronous data analysis. CEP processing rules are described in a SQL-like language, they are completely dynamic and as such they can be updated or deleted on-the-fly.\n \n \n  One of the key components of IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE is Esper (by EsperTech), an open-source event processing java library. Although IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE can perform well on the server side, it mainly targets hardware-constrained environments like embedded boards, SME boxes and gateways, high-end sensors, various mobile devices and so on...\n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Click here to access the FIWARE.OpenSpecification.IoT.Gateway.DataHandling document. IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE is fully integrated with the other enablers of FIWARE, especially using the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Next Generation Service Interface Context Enabler (NGSI 9 / NGSI 10) which is a very useful and easy format to encapsulate all data and events from RFID tags, Zigbee or IETF devices, as many other smart things.\n Send feedback \n\n\n\n \n       Label:\u00a0 \n     \n           A++ \n       \n \n Efficency Description:\u00a0 Cepheus \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Excellent \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very Good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       200 updates/sec \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory leak avoidable by configuration \n       B \n     \n   \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE - Cepheus", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Internet of Things Services Enablement      \n        Version:       0.1.6      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Ask in Stack Overflow with tag fiware      \n            fiware.d4m@orange.com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n Cepheus \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Excellent \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very Good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       200 updates/sec \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory leak avoidable by configuration \n       B \n     \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The  IoT Broker  implementation available through the FIWARE Catalogue is the reference implementation of this Generic Enabler by NEC. This implementation satisfies all properties described in the specification of the Generic Enabler.\n\nThe IoT Broker has unique properties that you will not find in other IoT Platforms:\n\n \n  While the IoT Broker GE decouples applications from underlying IoT device installations, it achieves this going far beyond the common publish/subscribe paradigm. Instead, the IoT Broker actively communicates simultaneously with large quantities IoT gateways and devices in order to obtain exactly the information that is required by the running IoT applications. As a result, information only is generated and exchanged when needed. This is in contrast to the state-of-the-art middleware components where any piece of information - whether needed or not - is just ''dumped'' inside a central repository.\n  The IoT Broker has the ability to automatically translate information to the right abstraction level and therefore closes the gap between information-centric applications and device-centric IoT installations. For example, a simple device can typically only deliver values without being aware of the meaning of these values in the application's context. On the other hand, IoT applications have to written without consideration of the device installations in order to be applicable in more than one specific environment. This gap is closed by the IoT Broker by the use of so-called  associations  between device-level and thing-level information.\n \n\nThe IoT Broker Generic Enabler is based on the simple and powerful information model standardized in  OMA Next Generation Service Interface Context Enabler (NGSI 9 / NGSI 10) . This API has emerged in FIWARE as an important open standard of information exchange, implemented by a considerable number of FIWARE GEs. In NGSI 9/10, all objects of the real world, being it sensor/actuator devices or arbitrary objects (like tables, rooms, cars, ...) are represented as so-called Context Entities, while information about these objects is expressed in the form of  attributes .

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular Generic Enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n \n 1. Access the  FIWARE Cloud Portal \n 2. Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on  FIWARE Identity Manager ) \n 3. Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the  row with the name  iotDiscovery-pep-r4_1_1   \n \nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nYou can use the  IoTDiscovery  blueprint template from the blueprint catalog to automate the installation of IoT Discovery and it's dependencies on your own VM, providing that your VM has the CHEF tool pre-installed. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nYou can use the  IoTDiscovery  blueprint template from the blueprint catalog to automate the installation of IoT Discovery and it's dependencies.\n \n Using the Docker container \nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions: \n \n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fi-ware.eu)  \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fi-ware.eu)  \n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the  row with the name  \"IoTBrokerV3.2\" or a later version.   \n \nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThe IoT Broker can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can go to the Instance tab and press the \u201cAdd software\u201d button to automatically install the GE from the software catalogue. The instructions to deploy software using recipes are available on a tutorial available on http://lab.fi-ware.org \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n(This feature will become available soon) \nThere may be Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates. The IoT Broker can be used as the basis for your own Blueprint Template or to extend the Blueprint Template you are defining for your own applications. The instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available from a tutorial available on http://lab.fi-ware.org \n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe Dockerfile can be found  here .\n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here .\n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "IoT Broker", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Internet of Things Services Enablement      \n        Version:       5.4.3      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Stefan Gessler, Flavio Cirillo      \n            iotplatform at neclab dot eu\n      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n Iot Broker \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Good \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Good \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0,07 tests failed/executed \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       2 average bugs priority \n       A \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       5,6 days \n       A+ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       16,4 days \n       C \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,15 response time/thread number \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       388,95 updates/sec \n       B \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory/CPU are progressively increasing but no leak \n       A \n     \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FIWARE Lab.\n  \nThere are five basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n Docker image \n Debian packages.  Facilitate installation on a Raspberry Pi. \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n\n    Access the FIWARE Lab portal (https://cloud.lab.fiware.org)\n    Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fi-ware.eu)\n    Click on the \"Image\" menu on the left. Search the \"Cepheus\" image in the table, then click on the corresponding \"Launch\" button on the same row.\n\nThen a usable Cepheus instance will be spawned from the image. See the FIWARE Lab portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Lab.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere may be Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates. The  cepheus  can be used as the basis for your own Blueprint Template or to extend the Blueprint Template you are defining for your own applications. The  cepheus  automates the deployment of a dedicated GE instance on top of several VMs via Chef recipes defined for  cepheus  in the software catalogue. The instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available from a tutorial available on http://lab.fiware.org\n \n Using the Docker container \nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance. The Dockerfile can be found  here . The DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here .\n \n Using Debian packages \nDebian packages optimized for Raspberry Pi can be found  here .    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "IoT Data Edge Consolidation GE - Cepheus", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Internet of Things Services Enablement      \n        Version:       0.1.6      \n        Updated:       2016-10-21      \n        Contact Person:       Ask in Stack Overflow with tag fiware      \n            fiware.d4m@orange.com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n            \n Cepheus \n \n   \n     \n       criteria \n       value \n       label \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       The overall label is the average of all individual labels assessed by Sep 2016  \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Documentation completeness \n       Excellent \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Documentation soundness \n       Very Good \n       A++ \n     \n     \n       APIs Failure Rate \n       0 tests failed/executed \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Detected defects by Priority \n       0 average bugs priority \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to respond issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Time to fix issues \n       < 1 day \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Scalability \n       1,02 response time/thread number \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Performance \n       200 updates/sec \n       A+++ \n     \n     \n       Stability \n       Memory leak avoidable by configuration \n       B \n     \n   \n \n      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The protocol adapter is designed to work with IBMs Moterunner platform and communicates via 6LoWPAN and uses CoAP as application layer protocol.\n\nThe MR CoAP adapter is designed to use IBMs Mote Runner operating system. Moterunner is a run-time platform running on the mote hardware that provides a virtual machine to execute device independent code. It was especially tailored for resource-constraint hardware environments. It uses a custom byte-code that is compact and efficient, with a very good energy tradeoff. It provides native support for reactive programming by means of delegates and supports Java and C# as high level programming languages. \n\nSupported sensor nodes include:\n \n Libelium Waspmote \n MESIC Iris \n \n\n WHY to get it \n\nIf you plan to integrate moterunner IoT devices into the FI-WARE ecosystem and have access to any moterunner device running the CoAP protocol.\n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 CoAP specification This protocol adapter implements the IETF CORE coap specification.

CEF eDelivery helps users to exchange electronic data and documents with one another in a reliable and trusted way. The CEF eDelivery solution is based on a distributed model called the \u201c4-corner model\u201d. In this model, the back-end systems of the users don\u2019t exchange data directly with each other but do this through Access Points. These Access Points are conformant to the same technical specifications and therefore capable of communicating with each other. As a result of this, users adopting CEF eDelivery can easily and safely exchange data even if their IT systems were developed independently from each other. \n\n Why to get it  \n\neDelivery helps to achieve the following goals: \n\n \n Interoperability:  Implementing common technical specifications that enable diverse organisations to exchange data and documents. \n Security:  Promoting an atmosphere of trust among all participants in the message exchange network. \n Scalability and Performance:  Enabling the number of participants in the data exchange network to grow as well as the number of exchanged messages. \n Legal Assurance and Accountability:  Promoting a high level of transparency and confidence among all participants in the message exchange network. \n  \n\nRe-using CEF eDelivery will accelerate the delivery time of a working document and data exchange network and reduces the cost and risk of creating, maintaining and operating such a network. CEF eDelivery was already tried and tested in multiple  domains.\n\n Open Specification reference \nDomibus is based on the e-SENS AS4 profile of the ebMS3 and AS4 OASIS Standards:\n\n\n\n e-SENS AS4 profile \n\n Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Electronic Data Exchange - Domibus", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       3.2      \n        Updated:       2016-10-17      \n        Contact Person:       CEF Support Team      \n            Email: CEF-EDELIVERY-SUPPORT@ec.europa.eu\nPhone: +32 2 299 09 09      \n            Incubated GEs/GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

It will ensure that FIWARE developers can leverage the docker ecosystem to create services composed of FIWARE GEs and deploy them on FIWARE Cloud compliant providers. To that end the Docker GE exposes the docker API on FIWARE and allows FIWARE developers to easily host their docker containers on the FIWARE Lab nodes or on their own on-premise FDCS.\n \n\n \nWhile users can use the Cloud Portal GE to interact with their docker hosts, the Docker GE also ensures that they can remotely create and manage their docker hosts, clusters and containers from their local docker clients.\n \n\n \nThe Docker GE shows how developers can leverage Docker Machine to deploy and manage docker hosts on the FIWARE lab.\n \n\n \nMore importantly, the Docker GE provides a service that relieves users from managing their own Docker hosts. Instead it introduces the FIWARE Docker Container Service (FDCS) which will allows users to focus solely on managing their containers in a secure environment. In addition to exposing the regular Docker capabilities FDCS provides authorization and authentication capabilities which allows it to support tenant isolation between different FIWARE accounts. The multi-tenant Docker support is integrated with FIWARE Keystone service and its existing accounts definitions. \nThe service also provides support for name scoping between tenants such that tenants can use the same docker resource names without interfering with each other.\n \n\n \nFDCS is deployed as on the FIWARE Lab so users can get its benefits by simply applying for admission to the service.\nAlternatively, FDCS can be installed on-premises so a site can deploy docker containers on their private FDCS cluster.  \n\n\n The main capabilities provided by FDCS are: \n \n  Multi-tenancy (support isolation between Contains of different accounts) \n   Name scoping (the same docker resource name can be used between tenants without interfering with each other )\n Manage life cycle Docker Hosts\n Manage network and storage attached Docker Hosts\n Resource monitoring of Docker Hosts\n Resiliency of the persistent data associated with Docker Hosts\n Manage resource allocation\n Secure access to the Docker Hosts\n Secure access to the Docker Containers \n \n\n Why to get it \n\n Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications. Docker lets you quickly assemble applications from components and eliminates the friction that can come when shipping code. Docker lets you get your code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible.\n \n \nThe Docker GE allows you take advantage of Docker to create FIWARE based services\nand easily host them in the FIWARE cloud.\nIt exposes the  Docker API .\n \n\n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Docker GE Open Specification Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Docker", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Cloud Hosting      \n        Version:       1.19      \n        Updated:       2016-08-11      \n        Contact Person:       Kenneth Nagin      \n            nagin@il.ibm.com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

Cyber Security GE leverages on top of some of the features of former GE called Security Monitoring. It goes beyond today\u2019s offers typically used by SMEs and/or citizens (e.g. Firewall, Anti-virus) as it not only enables complex attack detection, but also automatically computes possible countermeasures depending on the information about the sensitive data and IT system vulnerability. \n\n Why to get it \nCyberCAPTOR is the first step towards understanding the actual risk exposure of a future Internet environment and, hence, towards realizing the execution of services with desired security behavior and detection of potential attacks or non-authorized usage. \nThe target user for this GE is any organization willing to detect and manage the cyber-security risks of their information system or applications efficiently. This may include FIWARE infrastructure owners (e.g. FIWARE Lab) or SMEs using or building applications on top of the FIWARE platform.\n \n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Cyber Security GE \n \nThe main purposes of the Cyber Security GE can be summarized as follows:\n \n\n    1.Collect the vulnerabilities and evaluate the potential threats,\n \n\n    2.Identify most probable and impacting attacks,\n \n\n    3.Assess risk and propose remediation solutions,\n \n\n    4.Deliver a visualization service centered on risk/attrition level,\n \n\n    5.Provide Data Crisis sharing capabilities that preserve the privacy of the organization. \n \n \nTo achieve these purposes, the Cyber Security GE includes the following main components:\n \n\n- Cyber Data Extraction: In charge of extracting and processing all the raw cybersecurity-relevant data input by the user about his information system: network topology, firewall rules, vulnerability scan results (e.g. by Nessus), scoring preferences, etc. The output of this component is then used as input to the Attack Path engine and Remediation engine (see below). More information in the dedicated sub-section Cyber Data Extraction of section Basic Concepts.\n \n\n- Attack Graph Engine (MulVAL): A Topological Vulnerability Analyser (TVA) able to generate, from the output of Cyber Data Extraction (the parts related to the network topology and vulnerabilities of the information system) the attack graph regrouping all possible attack paths. This engine also combines the attack graph with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), to provide a quantitative analysis of individual vulnerabilities. More information in the dedicated sub-section Mulval Attack Path Engine of section Basic Concepts.\n \n\n- Scored Attack Paths: Analyzes the main attack paths of the attack graph provided by the Attack Graph Engine and computes a score for each attack path based on its business impact and probability of occurrence. The score basically represents the risk level. More information in the dedicated sub-section Scored Attack Paths of section Basic Concepts.\n \n\n- Remediation engine, helping to mitigate the risks and take efficient actions in accordance with the security policy by computing the different means to break the attack graph (so-called remediations) according to the AND/OR graph formalism and estimating a cost for each one. Once a security operator can actually select a specific attack path that he/she wants to prevent and get all the relevant alternatives of remediation. More information in the dedicated sub-section Remediation of section Basic Concepts.\n \n\n- Visualization interface: Provides a user interface for an operator to pilot the aforementioned components and to analyze dynamically the risk of an Information System. A security operator can use this application to visualize the possible attack paths that can face his/her Information System with their attrition level and the remediations that can correct them. This application can also be used for the Dynamic Risk Analysis of the Information System by taking into account the alerts issued by the SIEM (Security information and event management ) of the Information System when it exists, and matching them on the attack graph. More information in the dedicated sub-section Visualization of section Basic Concepts.\n \n\n- Privacy-Preserving (Crisis) Data Sharing (P2DS): enables an organization to share data relative to a crisis (successful attack with major business impact) with others without exposing confidential information about their compromised information system.

The Proactive Technology Online is a scalable integrated platform to support the development, deployment, and maintenance of event-driven applications. While standard reactive applications are based on reactions to single events, the Proton engine component reacts to situations rather than to single events. A situation is a condition that is based on a series of events that have occurred within a dynamic time window called a processing context. Situations include composite events (e.g., sequence), counting operators on events (e.g., aggregation) and absence operators.\nThe Proton engine is a run-time tool that receives information on the occurrence of events from event producers, detects situations, and reports the detected situations to external consumers.\n\n \n User and Programmers Guide \nThe Proactive Technology Online User Guide explains how to create a complex event processing (CEP) application. It describes the language constructs that are used to build CEP applications and includes tutorial that explains how this can be done using the Proactive Technology Onlineauthoring tool.\n\n\n \nThe Programmer Guide presents the Proton engine which is a run time component of the Proactive Technology Onlineasset. The programmer guide includes the high level architecture of the engine, the various supported adapters that can be used by the event producers to send events to the engine and the various supported adapters that can be used to send derived events from the engine to the consumers. It describes how a built-in adapter type can be used and how a new adapter type can be added. Configuration information and running instructions are also included.\n \n\n \nThe User and Programmers Guide can be found in the  FIWARE Wiki  or in  ReadTheDocs .\n \n\nProton CEP implements an API as follows:  CEP.API .\n\n Installation and Administration Guide \n\nThe Installation and Administration Guide can be found in the  FIWARE Wiki  or in  ReadTheDocs .\n\n Tutorials \nCheck out the course available from the FIWARE eLearning platform under  CEP GE .\n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Complex Event Processing (CEP) - Proactive Technology Online", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       Version 5      \n        Updated:       2016-08-07      \n        Contact Person:       Uri Shani      \n            SHANI@il.ibm.com   \n\n\n     IBM Haifa Research Lab\n\n\n      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Download       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customized options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine.\n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications.\nSee the  CEP Blueprint .\n \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure using Puppet.   There are instructions and scripts in the  CEP Puppet  page that allows you to deploy a VM with  puppet  agent on which you can load and run a CEP server. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities of puppet.\n \n \n Deploying Using the Docker container  which is the most simple and convenient to have a working CEP in minutes. For that, see  CEP Docker .\n \n \nFor this particular generic enabler instance the  available deployment methods  are as follows:\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal ( http://cloud.lab.fiware.org ) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on  http://account.lab.fiware.org ) \n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the  row with the name  cep-r5.4.1-img , which will launch an image identified as  cep-r5.4.1-img , when asked for the memory model (flavor) chose at least  m1.medium . \nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE. \nBy integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications.\nSee the  CEP Blueprint .\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure using  Puppet \nThe Proton Complex Event Processor can be installed on a machine, virtual or physical, installed with the puppet agent and deploy CEP on it according to the instructions in \n CEP Puppet , using the script  https://github.com/ishkin/Proton/blob/master/puppet/miscellaneous/CEP_Install_via_puppet.sh .\n\n Using the  Docker  container  \nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FI-LAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n With a Docker container : \n\n Using the version on Dockerhub \n docker run --rm --name cybercaptor-server -p 8080:8080 fiware/cybercaptor-server \n \n docker run --rm --name cybercaptor-client -p 8000:80 fiware/cybercaptor-client \n \n\n Building the Docker container : \nGuidelines can be found on Github : \n https://github.com/fiware-cybercaptor/cybercaptor-server/blob/master/container/README.md  \n https://github.com/fiware-cybercaptor/cybercaptor-client/blob/master/container/README.md \n \n\nFor the Privacy Preserving Data Sharing feature: \n \n https://github.com/fiware-cybercaptor/cybercaptor-P2DS \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation (deployed in a Docker container).\n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nN.A : deployed in a Docker container\n \n\n From Sources \n Software available on Github: \n \n \n https://github.com/fiware-cybercaptor/ \n \n \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Cyber Security GE - CyberCAPTOR", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Security      \n        Version:       R4      \n        Updated:       2016-02-02      \n        Contact Person:       Olivier Bettan      \n            olivier.bettan@thalesgroup.com      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fiware.org)\n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name  SpagoBI .\n \n\nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\n SpagoBI  GEri can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. SpagoBI Chef recipes are available within the FIWARE Chef Server. Furthermore the recipes for bootstrap SpagoBI using Chef are  here . \nIt's also possible to install SpagoBI into an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, using this command:\n \ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpagoBILabs/SpagoBI/master/ChefCookbooks/installation.sh | ssh -i [identity file] [sudo user]@[ip of machine]\n \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n\nThere may be Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates. The  spagobi  tier can be used as the basis for your own Blueprint Template or to extend the Blueprint Template you are defining for your own applications. The  spagobi  tier automates the deployment of a dedicated GE instance on top of several VMs via Chef recipes in the software catalogue.\n\nThe instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available on  http://help.lab.fiware.org .\n\n Using the  Docker  container \n\nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.\n\nThe DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here .    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Data Visualization - SpagoBI", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       5.2.1      \n        Updated:       2016-10-17      \n        Contact Person:       Davide Zerbetto      \n            Email: davide.zerbetto@eng.it      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The headers are X-Auth-Token and X-Auth-TenantId.\n\n The config.json takes the following form:\n\n \n{ \"HttpHeaders\":\n  {\n    \"X-Auth-Token\": keystone token id,      \n    \"X-Auth-TenantId\": keystone tenant id    \n  }\n}\n \n\n The default location of the configuration file is $HOME/.docker. But you can use the docker --config flag to indicate another directory.\n\n There are many ways to get your keystone token id and tenant id. For instance you could use curl. But we have provided a script called set-docker-config.bash that makes creating your config.json file easy.\n\n This is an example of using the script to create a docker configuration file at .docker/config.json:\n\n \n>set_docker_conf.bash -t fiware-tenant-name -u fiware-user-name -p user-password\n \n \nYou can download the set_docker_conf.bash at  download .\n \n\n Keystone tokens expire after approximately one day so you will need to update the configuration file daily.\n\n \n\n --Launch docker commands to run on FDCS: \n \n \nNow you can deploy and manage your docker containers with your\nlocal docker client, but all the docker requests will be transparently sent to FDCS.\n \n\n \n\n> docker run hello-world\n\nHello from Docker.\nThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n\nTo generate this message, Docker took the following steps:\n 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.\n 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \"hello-world\" image from the Docker Hub.\n 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the\n    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.\n 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it\n    to your terminal.\n\nTo try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:\n $ docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nShare images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker Hub account:\n https://hub.docker.com\n\nFor more examples and ideas, visit:\n https://docs.docker.com/userguide/\n\n> docker ps -a\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                             NAMES\nc1d22839920e        hello-world         \"/hello\"                 20 seconds ago      Exited (0) 17 seconds ago                                     docker-host-2\n\n\n \n\n \n For more details see the  FDCS User Guide        \n                  \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Docker", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Cloud Hosting      \n        Version:       1.19      \n        Updated:       2016-08-11      \n        Contact Person:       Kenneth Nagin      \n            nagin@il.ibm.com      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FI-LAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance using the Docker container.  There will be Docker images that will allow you to easily deploy an instance of the GE using the Docker container. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n In order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n \n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fiware.org)  \n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name \"domibus3.2_r5.4\". \n \nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on how to associate a Floating Ip and other info on VM management using FIWARE Cloud). \n\n How to use the instance \n\n The instance is already configured via a  Processing Mode (pMode) file  to send messages to our AP in  eDelivery's Connectivity Test Platform \n\n A  SoapUI project  is available to help you send messages via your instance. The steps are: \n \n save  the SoapUI project ZIP  to your disk and unzip it  \n open SoapUI and import the project (File->Import->browse to AS4ConnectivitySoapTest-soapui-project_gw8.xml) \n open AS4ConnectivitySoapTest->BackendService_1_1SoapBinding->SendMessage->Request 1 \n change the IP with your floating IP and click on the green button to send a message; the result will be a unique messageID  \n in the browser, go to  http://[your_floating_ip]:8080/domibus/home  to check your message was ACKNOWLEDGED \n \n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0user: user\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0password: 123456 \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance using the Docker container \nThis GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance.

Performance may be inadequate for achieving certain user experience goals, it may be more appropriate to save battery power, or for IP reasons, a designer may decide that the content of the user interface not be delivered to a client machine. In such cases, it should be possible that the UI is rendered on a server in the cloud, forwarding the display to and receiving input from client in a remote location. \n\n Goals \n\n The goal of this GE is to provide a generic way to request, receive and control a video stream of a remote 3D application. The complexity and usual heavy performance requirements for a 3D application can be offloaded to a server, from a low end device that could not handle the rendering otherwise. \n\n What you get \n\n Cloud Rendering GE provides a web service that can be used to implement your own 3D application rendering and interactions with the web client. Also provided are accompanying web client that shows how to talk to the web service and a renderer for the  realXtend Tundra  3D application SDK and the end user  Meshmoon Rocket  client.

It is very difficult to set up a communication environment and it is time you loose on what really matters, develop the main functionalities of your applications. Therefore, Cloud Messaging solves this problem for you, allowing you to focus on your domain. E,g. If you want to develop an application that updates the status of a delivered package in real-time, with a few lines of code, you can update this status from the mobile terminal to the transport operator's back-office. \n \n Open Specification Reference \n \n \nThis component has been designed according the  Cloud Messaging GE Open Specification .\n \n Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Cloud Messaging - AEON", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2015-11-26      \n        Contact Person:       Elisa Herrmann      \n            elisa.herrmann@atos.net      \n            Incubated GEs/GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

CKAN is aimed at data publishers (national and regional governments, companies and organizations) wanting to make their data open and available. \n\n Features include: \n \n Complete catalog system with easy to use web interface and a powerful API \n Strong integration with third-party CMS\u2019s like Drupal and WordPress \n Data visualization and analytics \n Workflow support lets departments or groups manage their own data publishing \n Fine-grained access control \n Integrated data storage and full data API \n Federated structure: easily set up new instances with common search \n \n\n Why to get it \n\n Data creates value. Governments do not have to provide all services around data themselves. They can empower citizens, organisations, and companies to make use of the data in new ways and unlock a lot of value for everyone. A  McKinsey Global Institute Report  estimates that access and re-usability of data across seven sectors of government can unlock between $3 trillion and $5 trillion in economic value annually. \n\n CKAN helps governments national and local, to unlock this value. CKAN is an open source platform which means it can be easily adapted and expanded, there are no upfront capital licensing costs. In addition, CKAN-based solutions eliminate the risk of lock-in to a sole vendor and ensures the opportunity to source support, customization and hosting from multiple providers going forward. \n\n Open Specification Reference \n\n The Open Specification of the GE can be found via the FIWARE website ( architecture  and  API specification ).

In this regard, the Business API Ecosystem GE is a joint component made up by integrating the FIWARE Business Framework with a set of standard APIs (and its reference implementations) provided by the TMForum in its TMF API ecosystem. \n\n This component allows the monetization of different kind of assets (both digital and physical) during the whole service life cycle, from offering creation to its charging, accounting and revenue settlement and sharing. In this way, the Business API Ecosystem provides sellers the means for managing, publishing, and generating revenue of they products, apps, data, and services. \n\n  By using the Business API Ecosystem you have access to the following key features: \n \n     Support for the management of catalogs, products, and offering \n     Support for rich pricing models, including recurring payments, pay-per-use, etc. \n     Support for accounting callbacks \n     Support for billing and charging \n     Integrated support for PayPal, including customer charges and seller payments \n     Support for revenue sharing, including models with multiple stakeholders involved \n \n\n The Business API Ecosystem exposes its complete functionality through TMForum standard APIs; concretely, it includes the catalog management, ordering management, inventory management, usage management, billing, customer, and party APIs. \n\n Why to get it \n\n In those fields where it is expected to create a real ecosystem of apps, data, and services (such as Smart Cities), offering third parties a way to enrich existing services and data, and enable monetization, is a key factor. In this regard, the integrated support for pricing (including pay-per-use modalities), accounting, charging, billing and revenue sharing offered by the Business API Ecosystem can position it one step ahead of the current market. \n\n Additionally, the TMForum APIs are design to enable repeatable and flexible integration among operations and management systems, making it easier to create, build and operate complex innovative services. The Business API Ecosystem exposes its functionality using the standard TMForum APIs; therefore, it takes advantage of the benefits on operation and management offered by such standards, allowing companies that plan to offer data and apps in such ecosystem to not adapt their systems ad-hoc. \n Open Specification reference:\u00a0 Business API Ecosystem Open Specification Biz Ecosystem RI is an implementation of the FIWARE/TMForum Business API Ecosystem Generic Enabler.\n\nMore specifically, the Biz Ecosystem RI implements the following APIs and Open Specifications:\n\n\n \n\n   Open API Specification \n\n Send feedback    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Business API Ecosystem - Biz Ecosystem RI", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       5.4.1      \n        Updated:       2017-01-31      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            Email: \nfdelavega@fi.upm.es\n\nAddress:\nSchool of Computer Science\nUniversidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid\nCampus de Montegancedo s/n\n28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

For those service providers,  the data analysis is not a goal itself but providing ways others can perform such data analysis .

A number of new technologies e.g CSS3 or access to novel input devices via DeviceAPI, provide capabilities previously only available in native user interface toolkits. A key component still missing in HTML is the ability for a Web application to define its own user interface components and reuse them easily as Web Components. The implementation should evaluate, provide, and possibly extend support for the necessary elements to define advanced and highly dynamic user interfaces based on HTML-5, including the ability to define reusable components for common 2D and 3D interaction techniques. The implementation should follow W3C and related standards as much as possible and extend them in suitable ways, where they are inadequate. Any new developments should be contributed back to the relevant standardization bodies. \n\n Goal \n The goal is to provide support for advanced, Web-based, highly dynamic, and potential 3D user interfaces. \n\n What you get \n A javascript library that handles generic web user interface input events like keyboard and mouse.\nThis GE provides means to dynamically add existing input devices input events such as touch pads and gamepad, and input event abstraction to handle keyboard key and mouse button combinations.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nYou can follow these steps to get a ready-to-use and readily configured instance of this GE:\n \n Login to http://cloud.lab.fiware.org with your credentials \n Create a security group under the \"Security\" section, and open port number 22 (for SSH access if wanted) and port number 80 for both TCP and UDP; \n Navigate to \"Images\" and select \"2d-ui-rX.X.X\", where X.X.X stands for version number (for example 3.3.3). Click on \"Launch\"; \n In step 2 of the \"Launch Instances\" window called \"Access & Security\", be sure to check your new created security group when creating the instance. \n Finish creating the instance, no further custom options are required; \n The instance will appear in the \"Instances\" section. Please wait until the \"Status\" column shows \"ACTIVE\", the \"Task\" column shows \"none\", and \"Power state\" is \"RUNNING\"; \n Attach a floating IP address in the \"Security\" section, so you can access it from anywhere on the internet. \n \nYour instance is now ready to use.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "2D-UI", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Advanced Web-based User Interface      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2016-02-10      \n        Contact Person:       Cvetan Stefanovski      \n            You can contact us with email at support@meshmoon.com      \n            Deprecated GEis      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer). \n\n There are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available: \n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \n\n In order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEri perform the following actions: \n \n     Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n     Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on https://account.lab.fiware.org) \n     Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name business-api-ecosystem-x.x.x. \n \n\n In a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEri will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud). \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \n\n The Business API Ecosystem GEri can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can use the chef client to automatically install the GEri and additional software from the software catalogue. \n\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \n\n There are Blueprint Templates associated to this GE in the catalogue of available FIWARE Blueprint Templates in the FIWARE Lab Cloud. To deploy this GEri using the available blueprint perform the following actions: \n\n \n     Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n     Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on https://account.lab.fiware.org) \n     Click on the \"Blueprint Templates\" option at the left \n     Click on the \"Open Catalog\" option. \n     Clone the template called \"Business-API-Ecosystem\" \n     Configure the tiers of the blueprint with your security keys \n     Launch the template \n \n\n The instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available from a tutorial available on http://help.lab.fiware.org \n\n Using the  Docker  container  \n\n This GE implementation provides a Docker container that can be used to run your own instance. \n\n The Dockerfiles can be found  here \n\n The DockerHub page for this GE implementation can be found  here    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Business API Ecosystem - Biz Ecosystem RI", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Applications/Services and Data Delivery      \n        Version:       5.4.1      \n        Updated:       2017-01-31      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            Email: \nfdelavega@fi.upm.es\n\nAddress:\nSchool of Computer Science\nUniversidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid\nCampus de Montegancedo s/n\n28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      \n            FIWARE GEris      \n        Feedback:       Send feedback      \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE LAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nThere are no images created for this GE implementation yet.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nCKAN GEi can be installed via Chef recipes deploying an image with a chef agent installed. Then, you can use the chef client to automatically install the GEi (called CKAN) and additional software from the software catalogue.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nBlueprint Templates can be created for this GE in the FIWARE Lab Cloud. To deploy this GEi using a blueprint perform the following actions:\n  1. Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n  2. Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on https://account.lab.fiware.org) \n  3. Create a Blueprint Template from the base_ubuntu_12.04 image with ckan 2.5 added to the tier using the m1.small flavour (or larger). \n  4. Create and downloaded a Keypair and pem file from Security > Keypairs \n  5. Use 'Launch New Blueprint' from Blueprint Instances to launch an instance using the CKAN template. \n  6. Allocate an IP to the project from the public-ext-net-01 pool and associated it with the new instance (after waiting for the instance to finish spinning up so the internal IP is available). \n The instructions to define, extend and instantiate blueprint templates are available from a tutorial available on http://help.lab.fiware.org    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "CKAN", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Data/Context Management      \n        Version:       2.5      \n        Updated:       2016-03-30      \n        Contact Person:       ckan-fiware@okfn.org      \n            This is an email alias that goes to a number of people within Open Knowledge, the organisation that originally developed CKAN and continue to support it.

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FI-LAB (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nThere are no images created for this GE implementation yet.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nIt is possible to deploy the Cloud messaging GE using puppet recipes.

Its goal is to aid the user in identifying performance bottlenecks. Trace Analyzer reads in traces from various sources, and displays time-based graphical visualization of the program execution as well as a list of trace contents and the event details for selection.\n\n What you get \nA set of Eclipse plug-ins that provide a means to collect, analyze and visualize information from:\n \n tcpdump (or equivalent - format may need 'massaging') tool for network information \n SAR tool for operating system information \n \nIn addition, a remote invocation plug-in that can run the above tools on a remote machine, bringing the output to the user.\n\n Why get it \nTrace Analyzer adds a new dimension to application performance testing. It complements existing tools for operating system and network monitoring by providing information on top of that provided by those tools. Trace Analyzer can emphasize information pertaining performance issues which may otherwise remain hidden.\nIt can do what humans are unable to, for example - reconstruct TCP sessions accentuating abnormal response times, or identify the point at which excess system resources are used.\n\nOverall, Trace Analyzer greatly aids in improving productivity.    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Trace Analyzer", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Tools      \n        Version:            \n        Updated:       2013-11-29      \n        Contact Person:       Marcel Zalmanovici      \n            marcel [at] il.ibm.com      \n                 \n        Feedback:            \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

This is particularly important for services with sparse monitoring data due to their infrequent invocation in the composition. Still, assuring the quality of all the composed services is important to assure the reliability of the running composition instances, and avoid critical consequences when they deviate from their expected quality. Response time is a key quality attribute for the Internet of Services.\nThe additional response times collected from online testing can be augmented with the response times collected from monitoring, thereby allowing the tester to take more informed decisions about the quality of the those services and whether runtime management activities need to be initiated.\nMoreover, the tester can use PROSA to proactively identify response time violations by online testing.

The key objective of a SBF is to build and support an ecosystem of applications and services that is sustainable and fosters innovation as well as cross-fertilization. In particular, it consists of a number of interrelated components that support managing services in the business framework across the whole service lifecycle: from creation and composition of services to monetization and revenue sharing. \n\n The Wirecloud (App Mashup) Monetization Bundle represents one of the uses cases of the Service Business Framework and intends to show the potential of the SBF features provided by FIWARE in a concrete use case. This use case is based on the use of the SBF to monetize the mashable application components used in Wirecloud. \n\n This bundle includes the set of GEis that support different monetization and revenue sharing features of SBFs plus the application that will be the client of those services: Wirecloud. The final list of the GEis included in this bundle is: \n\n \n     Marketplace RI (Marketplace GEi): This GEi is in charge of bringing together offering and demand allowing the publication and search of offerings that are offered in different Stores. The rketplace also includes some lateral functions such as review, rating and recommendation of offerings. \n\n     Repository RI (Repository GEi): This GEi provides a consistent uniform API to USDL service descriptions and associated media files for applications and services offered in the business famework. \n\n     WStore (Store GEi): While the marketplace is a platform for many stores to place their offerings to a broader audience and consumers to search and compare services and find the store where to buy, WStore GEi is in charge of the final business transaction (buying) and the whole back office process; that is, the end-to-end managing of offerings and sales including the charging of the customer. \n\n     RSS GEi: This GEi is in charge of distributing the revenues originated by the business transactions of a given application among several stakeholders involved. In particular, it focuses on sharing part of the revenue generated by an application between WStore GEi instance provider and the service provider(s) responsible for the offering.\n Note:  The RSS GE does not have a recipe, but it is available as a global instance in the FIWARE Lab. Therefore, the blueprint for this bundle does not configure this GEri.\nNevertheless, the user guide of the Store GEri (see Administration section) explains how to connect the Store to a RSS instance once it has been deployed (e.g through this blueprint) \n\n     Wirecloud (Application Mashup GEi): This GEi builds on cutting-edge end-user development, RIA and semantic technologies to offer a next-generation end-user centred web application Mashup platform aimed at leveraging the long tail of the Internet of Services. Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application logic, and UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent and value-adding composite applications. Wirecloud uses the SBF functionalities for monetizing those components (widgets, operators and their composition: mashups). \n \n\n It is necessary to remark that this bundle requires to be deployed in a FIWARE instance since it requires an Identity Manager to work. Note that for a correct management of the business process, user and organization information should be shared by the different GEis. \n\n This bundle has all the features of the Business Framework Bundle: \n\n \n     Support for Linked USDL standard, including storage of services and offerings USDL descriptions thought Repository-RI. \n     Creation of offerings under different pricing models (including payments, subscriptions and pay-per-use) allowing the monetization of applications and services thought WStore (Store GEi). \n     Publication of offerings offered in WStore in Marketplace-RI in order to allow making then visible to a higher number of potential customers \n     Search, comparison and acquisition of offerings thought Marketplace-RI and WStore. \n     Support for sharing the different revenues, generated during the business process, between the involved stakeholders thought the RSS GEi. \n     Support for storing business transactions through the RSS GEi. \n \n\n Plus the features provided by Wirecloud and their integration with the SBF: \n\n \n     Support for publishing, discovering and monetizing application mashup components thought the SBF. \n \n\n Why to get it \n\n On the one hand, The Wirecloud Monetization Bundle offers an environment where application mashup component providers can meet potential customers bringing together offering and demand while supporting the complete offering live cycle, from the creation and publication of service and application offerings under flexible and complex pricing models, to the acquisition and charging of those offerings including the revenue sharing between the involved stakeholders. \n\n On the other hand, the Wirecloud Monetization Bundle relies in the Linked USDL standard for the definition of offerings providing fully support for this standard and storage for the different documents that describe the offered digital assets. \n\n Moreover, although the Wirecloud Monetization Bundle is useful in itself, it represents a good example of how to implement monetization of services/components and can be used as base/skeleton for implementing monetization in other use cases. \n\n Generic enablers of the bundle \n\n The different Catalogue pages describing GEs included in the Wirecloud Monetization Bundle can be found following: \n \n     Marketplace GE \u2013 SAP-RI \n     Repository GE \u2013 SAP-RI \n     Store GE - WStore \n     RSS GE \n     Application Mashup GE - Wirecloud \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Wirecloud Monetization", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Version:       1.0      \n        Updated:       2014-11-18      \n        Contact Person:       \u00c1lvaro Arranz      \n            Email: aarranz@fi.upm.es \r\nAddress: School of Computer Science Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid Campus de Montegancedo s/n 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Bundle Deployment       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The Marketplace also includes some lateral functions such as review, rating and recommendation of offerings. \n     Repository RI (Repository GEi): This GEi provides a consistent uniform API to USDL service descriptions and associated media files for applications and services offered in the business framework. \n     WStore (Store GEi): While the marketplace is a platform for many stores to place their offerings to a broader audience and consumers to search and compare services and find the store where to buy, WStore GEi is in charge of the final business transaction (buying) and the whole back office process; that is, the end-to-end managing of offerings and sales including the charging of the customer. \n     RSS GEi: This GEi is in charge of distributing the revenues originated by the business transactions of a given application among several stakeholders involved. In particular, it focuses on sharing part of the revenue generated by an application between WStore GEi instance provider and the service provider(s) responsible for the offering.\n Note:  The RSS GE does not have a recipe, but it is available as a global instance in the FIWARE Lab. Therefore, the blueprint for this bundle does not configure this GEri.\nNevertheless, the user guide of the Store GEri (see Administration section) explains how to connect the Store to a RSS instance once it has been deployed (e.g through this blueprint) \n \n\n It is necessary to remark that this bundle requires to be deployed in a FIWARE instance since it requires an Identity Manager to work. Note that for a correct management of the business process, user and organization information should be shared by the different GEis \n\n Some of the key features provided by this bundle include \n\n \n     Support for Linked USDL standard, including storage of services and offerings USDL descriptions thought Repository-RI. \n     Creation of offerings under different pricing models (including payments, subscriptions and pay-per-use) allowing the monetization of applications and services thought WStore (Store GEi). \n     Publication of offerings offered in WStore in Marketplace-RI in order to allow making then visible to a higher number of potential customers \n     Search, comparison and acquisition of offerings thought Marketplace-RI and WStore. \n     Support for sharing the different revenues, generated during the business process, between the involved stakeholders thought the RSS GEi. \n     Support for storing business transactions through the RSS GEi. \n \n\n Why to get it \n\n On the one hand, The Business Framework Consumption Bundle offers an environment where service providers can meet potential customers bringing together offering and demand while supporting the complete offering live cycle, from the creation and publication of service and application offerings under flexible and complex pricing models, to the acquisition and charging of those offerings including the revenue sharing between the involved stakeholders. \n\n On the other hand, the Business Framework Consumption Bundle relies in the Linked USDL standard for the definition of offerings providing fully support for this standard and storage for the different documents that describe the offered digital assets. \n\n Generic enablers of the bundle \n\n The different Catalogue pages describing GEs included in the Business Framework Consumption Bundle can be found following: \n \n     Marketplace GE \u2013 SAP-RI \n     Repository GE \u2013 SAP-RI \n     Store GE - WStore \n     RSS GE \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Business Framework Consumption", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Version:       1.0      \n        Updated:       2014-11-18      \n        Contact Person:       Francisco de la Vega      \n            Email: fdelavega@fi.upm.es \r\nAddress: School of Computer Science Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid Campus de Montegancedo s/n 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Bundle Deployment       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

From the point of view of a mashup application component provider , the usage scenario describes the creation and publication of offerings including application mashup components thought the different services involved. \n\n Before creating offerings containing application mashup components, those components should be uploaded to the deployed WStore server. To register those assets, the application mashup component provider can use the Web interface provided by the WStore service or directly with the Web interface provided by Wirecloud. \n\n Once the digital assets to be offered have been registered, the next step consists on the creation of the offering in WStore using the web interface provided. To create the offering the application mashup component provider has to provide an USDL document and select the different downloadable assets previously registered in the WStore server. The provider can make use of the simple USDL creation form provided by WStore for creating simple USDL documents. During this process WStore uploads the USDL description of the offering to the Repository. \n\n The final step consists on the publication of the offering. Since the offering has been created in WStore, its web interface can be used for the publication. When an offering has been published, it is included in the Marketplace in order to make them available to potential customers. \n\n From the point of view of a customer , the usage scenario describes the discovery, acquisition, charging and revenue sharing processes. \n\n On a first step, the customer searches, either using the Marketplace interface or by using the Wirecloud\u2019s Web interface for accessing the Marketplace, an offering that fits her needs. Once she founds an offering, she is redirected to WStore where she can buy it and get charged. After an offering has been purchased, she can make use of the associated application mashup components directly thought the Wirecloud\u2019s Web interface or manually (for example, by downloading them from the store and uploading them in the WireCloud instance of choice). \n\n Every time the customer is charged, WStore feeds the RSS with charging information that is used by this component in order to distribute the generated revenues between the different stakeholders of the offering. \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "Wirecloud Monetization", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Version:       1.0      \n        Updated:       2014-11-18      \n        Contact Person:       \u00c1lvaro Arranz      \n            Email: aarranz@fi.upm.es \r\nAddress: School of Computer Science Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid Campus de Montegancedo s/n 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid (Spain)      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Bundle Deployment       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

Instead of directly accessing the GEs during development, you may choose to interact with the NGSI10 Test Server instead. When accessing the NGSI10 Test Server, it will then provide lots of useful information in the status field of the reply (which is human readable). The information provided by the NGSI10 Test Server is embedded in valid replies to server invocations (though it does not implement the fully-fledged NGSI functionality). You can also test if your client is able to fully understand and handle those valid replies. When you are done testing the NGSI10-based interaction with the NGSI10 Test Server, then you can swap out the test server and swap in the actual GE. \n To get an idea about typical responses, please navigate to  http://130.206.81.82:8080/NGSI10/contextEntities/my_house . \nMore detailed information can be found in the  User and Programmer Guide . \nA training course is available at  http://edu.fiware.org/course/view.php?id=60 .  \n Quickstart \n To get started, please navigate to  http://130.206.81.82:8080/NGSI10/contextEntities/my_house . The result will probably not be formatted nicely and hard to read. In order to get a prettier output, please install a REST client addon to your browser (see below). Then start the addon and, within the addon!, navigate to the URL given above. Make sure to specify GET as the request method. You should get a response with status code 200 (OK) and a response body that tells you all the context information available for \"my_house\", like this: \n <contextElementResponse xmlns:xsi=\"<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> \n\">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> \n</a>  <contextElement> \n    <entityId> \n      <id>my_house</id> \n        <!-- lots of context information about \"my house\" --> \n  </contextElement> \n  <statusCode> \n    <!-- lots of information about your request --> \n  </statusCode> \n</contextElementResponse> \n The statusCode element contains lot of information about your request that come in handy when debugging the request sent by you (and your software), such as the headers you sent (e.g. the MediaType and the query parameters). Now change the request method to POST and fire the request again. You should get a status code of 400 (Bad Request) with lots of information what went wrong. \n RESTful browser addons \n Google Chrome: \"Simple REST Client\" addon\n Mozilla Firefox: \"RESTClient addon \"\n Safari: \"RESTClient\" addon\n \n  Attachment Size   \n \n    2013-08-09 NGSI Test Environment Introduction.zip 1.8 MB   \n \n \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "FIWARE NGSI10 TestServer", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Tools      \n        Version:       1.0      \n        Updated:       2015-03-24      \n        Contact Person:       Oliver Kasten      \n            oliver.kasten@sap.com      \n                 \n        Feedback:            \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

The following is a description of those facilities in the FI-PPP Testbed (available to FI-PPP partners) and the FIWARE Lab (open to any developer).  \nThere are three basic automated deployment mechanisms available:\n \n Images . A ready-made Virtual Machine, with the GE deployed and properly configured. This is pretty simple but it does not allow for any customised options and it requires a dedicated Virtual Machine. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure.   There will be images that will allow you to deploy a VM that contains a chef agent. Once such VM is deployed, you can deploy the GE software plus additional software by using automated facilities. \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE.  By integrating or extending a Blueprint Template available for this GE you can define your own Blueprint Template which defines the virtual infrastructure for your applications. \n \n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on an image \nIn order to deploy a dedicated instance of this GEi perform the following actions:\n \n Access the FIWARE Cloud Portal (http://cloud.lab.fiware.org) \n Login with your login/password (if you don't have a login/password, please register on http://account.lab.fi-ware.eu) \n Click on the \"Images\" option at the left, then \"Launch\" selecting the row with the name NGSI-TestServer v1.0 OC  \n \nIn a matter of minutes a ready-to-use VM instance of this GEi will appear in the \"Instances\" area (see the FIWARE Cloud Portal guide for additional information on VM management using FIWARE Cloud).\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance in your own virtual infrastructure \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n Deploying a dedicated GE instance based on blueprint templates for this GE \nThere are no recipes created for this GE implementation yet.\n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "FIWARE NGSI10 TestServer", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Chapter:       Tools      \n        Version:       1.0      \n        Updated:       2015-03-24      \n        Contact Person:       Oliver Kasten      \n            oliver.kasten@sap.com      \n                 \n        Feedback:            \n                 ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Creating Instances       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Downloads       \n   \n      \n            Instances       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

HTML5 events, like \" onclick \", can be registered on the models to provide an easy way to define interaction. XML3D runs in every browser that supports WebGL, including WebGL capable browsers on mobile devices.\n GIS Data Provider - Geoserver /3D:  This GE is able to host geographical data and serve it in 3D form (where applicaple) to both mobile and web clients. It is built of a server, which is able to process geolocated queries, an extension to it which is able to manage 3D data and a backend database where all geolocated data is saved.\n POI Data Provider:  POI (Points of interest) Generic Enabler is a web server kit that supports storing information related to locations. This information can be queried by location and other criteria. Once deployed, POI Data Prover can be configured to meet your data needs\n FI-Content 3D-Map Tiles SE:  The 3D-Map Tiles Specific Enabler of FI-Content II concludes this bundle by providing a convenient interface to query 3D map data from GIS data provider as XML3D assets. The 3D-Map Tiles SE allows to query geo data in an Open Streetmap like tile based manner. For each tile you request, you will receive a ready-to-use XML3D asset with 3D ground and building data as well as textures that can be referenced immediately in your XML3D scene.\n Why to get it \n 3D-UI-XML3D Geo Visualization provides a complete framework to display landscapes that are automatically generated from map data. You may use this bundle to highlight special points of interests during special events in your city, for interactive virtual tour guides in your area, or comparable applications. The provided base application can easily be extend to fit your own needs. \n Generic enablers of the bundle \n The XML3D Geo Visualization bundle makes use of three Generic Enablers which can be found in the Catalogue: \n   3D-UI-XML3D \n   GIS Data Provider / GeoServer 3D \n   POI Data Provider \n It moreover includes the 3D-Map-Tiles Specific Enabler of the FI-Content project: \n   FI-Content 2 3D-Map-Tiles Specific Enabler \n    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "3D-UI-XML3D Geo Visualization", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Updated:       2014-12-05      \n        Contact Person:       Torsten Spieldenner      \n            torsten.spieldenner@dfki.de      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Bundle Deployment       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},

Developers and providers can deploy and configure the bundle to visualize a specific region based on Geo Data. End users will access the 3D front end to view and interact with the visualization of the respective geo region.\n \n \n Developers  will deploy the instances that are contained in the bundle blueprint and, with that, start web servers that provide the respective services. These include GIS Data Provider and POI Data Provider in particular.\n \n \nIn a next step, the data provider services will be filled with the respective data. The corresponding steps that need to be taken are explained in detail in the respective manuals of the individual GE. As soon as this step is done, the developer can adapt the provided sample application to fit to their needs\n \n \n Users  will visit the interactive Geo visualization in their web browsers. 3D-UI-XML3D provides them with an interactive 3D rendered version of the region that was specified by the developer before. 3D-UI-XML3D works with standard HTML5 events and comes with a predefined camera controller, so that users can explore the scene with simple keyboard and mouse input.    \n\n  \n  \n \n   \n\n  \n  ", "enabler": "3D-UI-XML3D Geo Visualization", "meta": "\n      \n                 \n        Updated:       2014-12-05      \n        Contact Person:       Torsten Spieldenner      \n            torsten.spieldenner@dfki.de      ", "topbar": "\n             \n       Overview      \n  \n  \n  \n       \n         \n      \n            Bundle Deployment       \n   \n      \n            Documentation       \n   \n      \n            Terms and conditions       \n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n"},
